The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Much better than the others.;13.06.2006;True;"Got a free screening pass to see it 6-12, saw it with some car buddies, the dork I am took notes.

This movie had more semblance of a plot than the rest of the franchise, the action stayed fresh and actually flowed with the plot, and the characters actually had motivation this time! There weren't any HUGE glaring inaccuracies (other than daddy throwing sonny the keys to a car with NO ENGINE in it...) The three cameos in the film were well placed, though a bit campy at the very end. The cars and action sequences were amazingly choreographed, one even leaving my whole theatre clapping for the protagonist.

I give 8/10 because of low expectations, and being totally blown away when it was much better than I expected."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;The Slow and The Stupid: Part III;30.07.2006;True;"I enjoyed the first two films, which were better than average popcorn flicks, but this (almost) completely unrelated crapfest is a complete waste of your filmgoing dollars. It's ridiculous and it's boring.

The main character, Sean, is a 34 year old street racer who has apparently been held back in school....for seventeen years. He's the oldest high school student on Planet Earth. In fact, in a remarkable feat of human biology, he is about the same age as his mother and father! He also has the most improbable and unconvincing Southern US accent imaginable.

After smashing up some cars and destroying an entire housing development, he is sent to live in Japan with his Navy dad (who apparently fathered him at the age of about 9). For reasons never explained, his father is not allowed to live on the Naval base, but has to reside in a minuscule Japanese slum and Sean (yup, still in high school, despite middle age) doesn't go to the Navy base school, where instruction would be in English, but instead is enrolled at a private Japanese academy despite the fact that he knows not a single word of Japanese. Apparently no one, not even his teachers there, seem to think this will be a problem.

Naturally, the first girl he sees in class is the only Caucasian student in the entire school, if not the entire city, and so she becomes the (very boring) love interest. He also meets the only African American student. Obviously these two must be his best friend and girlfriend since they are the only non-Asians around.

Subsequently, he gets into ""drift racing"", something I never heard of before and I can see why. It's not very interesting to watch. Apparently it consists of taking a small import vehicle with front wheel drive, and while going fast through a sharp turn, allowing the car to fishtail. While this seems possible enough (for a skilled stunt driver on a closed track, per the credits), I do wonder if it is possible to do this continuously while driving, i.e., to essentially drive sideways almost the entire time. Seriously, I doubt this. It's also not especially fast, which makes it fairly dull to watch.

Also, the big ""final race"" occurs, and the hero's dad (amazingly) has the body of a classic 60s Mustang in his garage (a somewhat unlikely situation in Japan -- not just the car, but the idea that he has a entire garage for this purpose in one of the world's most expensive and crowded cities). So Sean and his friends take the engine out of one of the Japanese cars he has wrecked earlier in the film, and in a few hours they manage to install this into the 60s muscle car. HELLO? Is this possible? I admit I am not a mechanic or specialist, but it does not seem logical that you could retrofit a Japanese front wheel drive engine into a vintage 60s American rear wheel drive car....if it could be done AT ALL, it seems to me that it would take a long time and involve a lot of custom parts. That's not even considering that they drive on the opposite side of the road in Japan, or that a 60s era car would be much heavier than a current model Japanese car.

There are too many other absurdities to list, along with the inclusion of the Yakuza (Japanese mafia). I wish I could say that ""Toyko Drift"" was campy, or that you could have a good time just laughing at the many absurdities, but actually its fatal flaw is that it is extremely dull. The least you would expect from it, title- wise, is that there would be lots of exciting racing -- and there isn't -- and that the hero would probably have a hot, sexy Japanese girlfriend and sexy love scenes -- and there is absolutely nothing in this regard (as he's barely hooked up with the only Caucasian woman in his high school). The film is entirely devoid of sex appeal, you could show it to a convention of Mormons.

SPOILER ALERT Because it's so dumb and utterly lame, I am alerting anyone (who has seen the TV ads) that Vin Diesel does appear, in his role from the first film, for a few seconds at the very end. It's stupid and it's gratuitous, and it says something terribly sad about both this film, and Mr. Diesel's career (that he was able to be compelled to appear, even uncredited). This is a franchise with every ounce of the life juice sucked out.

Here is hoping that they never, ever consider making ""Fast & Furious IV""."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is far better than I expected - but I had low expectations. Enjoyable but not ;21.06.2006;True;"I was quite surprised by The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Of course, I expected it to be a pile of steaming garbage, particularly with the formula of increasingly dodgy sequels. So when I went to see it with some friends, I had obvious misgivings. These misgivings, or at least the worst ones, such as the movie being unbearable to even look at, were fortunately unfounded. I kept my eyes on the movie the whole time, mainly because of the souped cars, but the fact that I went through the movie without flinching (a lot, except at some of the bad dialogue that was prevalent), says quite a lot. Maybe my view of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift is heightened by the fact that I cracked a few jokes during the movie.

Now down to business. Sean, a 'dude' who loves to race at high speeds for no apparent reason, is sent to Tokyo to live with his military dad and ends up being drawn to the racing circuit again, witnessing a new style of race called 'drift' (as seen in Need For Speed Underground, to those that don't know). Sounds stupid? Well, it is, the casual viewer can detect a plothole or two from even reading those two lines. To go on, except to state that Sean ends up making friends with a guy named Han, is pointless. I will admit that no-one looks for a good plot in a Fast and the Furious movie, but still, the less said, the better.

The dialogue, as I stated, can be funny - because of its stupidity. This is shown by one piece of dialogue where some guy asks Sean: ""You know what DK stands for?"" and Sean replies ""Donkey Kong"". At least its original, I guess.

The acting is OK - far from turgid, which I expected it to be in the first place. The guy who plays Han is surprisingly good, going through the movie without looking as if he was hired from a nearby sushi bar. Brian Tee as DK is a bit of a joke, he is more comedic than menacing. Lucas Black is OK as Sean, but his Southern accent makes his character more irritating to watch. The love interest does well as eye candy. That's about all that matters I guess.

The most important part of The Fast and the Furious is inarguably the racing sequences and their overall effectiveness. I will admit that the sequences themselves are well-filmed and eye catching, highlighting the cars, as they should. However, except in a few fleeting moments, they are not as enthralling as they should be and this is one of the most disappointing aspects of The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The final confrontation, for me, is pretty good to watch, but only arouses the senses once in a while.

Time didn't drag though, which is a clear sign that The Fast and Furious is indeed quite watchable, despite its other pre-eminent faults. I admit that I didn't really get bored during the film, which may lead to my rose-tinted view of it (compared to my original perception of what it would be like).

So let me summarise my thoughts: ""Didn't expect much, got more than I bargained for."" The acting is satisfactory (for a racing film, otherwise it would more or less suck), the plot and the dialogue are predictably terrible, the racing sequences are satisfactory and the cinematography is somewhat effective, with frequent close-ups of the cars. What compels me to give The Fast and The Furious a pass grade is the fact that it is, like I said, quite watchable. However, it is still little more than satisfactory, so it's rating cannot therefore rise above:"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Surprisingly good - Sung Kang steals the show;14.06.2006;True;"I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway, I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah, this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it's actually pretty entertaining, and isn't all that bad.

We are introduced to Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a high school kid who can't seem to find his niche in life. He's moved from town to town with his divorced mother, and getting into problems with the law, before finding himself in Southern California. The California scenes pay homage to Justin Lin's earlier film, Better Luck Tomorrow, almost feeling like an extension of that film. We see the crowds of students in the courtyard, almost peripheral to a particular point in time. Moving to California doesn't change anything, and Sean, the outsider, finds himself racing Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan, from Home Improvement), a rich kid who has it all, including a brand new Dodge Viper.

In trouble with the law yet again, Sean finds himself moving to Japan, for reasons that aren't particularly clear. We don't know exactly why he *had* to move; however, it doesn't really matter anyway.

Sean continues to find himself as an outsider. From his distant father, to his language barrier, to being unfamiliar with traditional customs. Unlike other particular American films, the culture of Japan was portrayed in a positive light. This was particularly refreshing, as the food jokes, Engrish jokes, height jokes, etc. have become very tiresome over the years.

Sean meets Twinkie (Lil Bow Wow), and Han (Sung Kang), the latter of which appears to be the same character from Better Luck Tomorrow. Both Twinkie and Han serve as guides or mentors to Sean, as he becomes more familiar with Japan, school, drifting, and its associated group. In retrospect, Twinkie seems like an unnecessary character, and quickly gets shelved to Sung Kang's Han, who steals the show like a pimp.

Sean also meets, and is attracted to Neela (Nathalie Kelley), who is the girlfriend of DK (Brian Tee). DK is a nickname for ""Drift King."" Sean quickly realizes this as he loses badly to him in his first race in Japan (and smashing up Han's S15 badly). The altercation between Sean and DK heats up leading to the climax of the film.

Sean Boswell is an unlikeable character. His mannerism is interesting during the California scenes and you actually do get to like him, however he quickly outwears his welcome. From his unjustified temper, to his grating southern accent, Han becomes more of the likable protagonist.

The dialogue was cheesy as hell too (remember the ""I'm free"" line from the first one? This is worse - the moonlight drifting scene is embarrassingly bad).

Character development is too hurried at times, much like this review.

As with Kill Bill, Sonny Chiba is as charming as ever, this time playing a Yakuza boss, who happens to be the uncle of DK.

Now, the racing scenes were actually not that bad. Compared to the outlandish effects of the first two FF films, Tokyo Drift is pretty understated.

Racing-wise, this was a vendor-fest. 350Z's (VERY prominently displayed), RX-8's, and an EVO. Other than that, there was an R34 GT-R, S15, and the Veilside RX-7. That's really about it (with the obvious exception of the Mustang). I think I saw a glimpse of an AE86 hatch.

Will it make people drift in the parking lot leaving the theatre? Yes. In fact, I saw some guy in a Camry attempting to do so.

Will it spark interest in the vendor-sponsored cars? Probably.

Will it increase resale value of your S13 or AE86? Probably not.

Finally, there are two notable cameos in this film (among others). The first cameo has to do with ""DK"" (not the film character). The second cameo ties the film to its predecessor. Both appearances were pretty well done and drew laughter from the crowd."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;True to the Title!!!;04.06.2006;True;This movie was Fast. This movie was Furious. And all in an okay way. Being a major fan of the franchise, I was eager to see how the third would turn out. Knowing someone in the movie biz, who worked on the movie, Neal H. Moritz (His credits being the producer of the first Fast & Furious Movies, Vin Diesel's xXx, xXx State of the Union, SWAT, and more) I got to be the first of many to go to the World Premiere. The movie was entertaining, not the greatest storyline, but this movie had the most intense and exhilarating car chases, probably ever put on the big screen. Lucas Black, the lead in this movie, playing the cool, car maniac, did a good job to fill the shoes Paul and Vin left behind. If you are a fan of the first two, I do suggest this movie to you. And even if you're not a fan, but you are into the Drift world of Car racing, this is your movie. In my opinion, The FAST & FURIOUS movies, are some of my top favorite movies of all time. So I must say that even with a somewhat weak storyline, this movie did earn the title FAST & THE FURIOUS.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;Worse than the worst movie ever;16.06.2006;True;We just saw this movie in Kansas City and to say that it was a huge disappointment does not begin to tell how bad it was. The race sequences were okay, but there is absolutely no point to the dialog or plot. This movie is unbelievably demeaning to women, starting with the blonde babe at the beginning who offers herself as the prize to the winner of the race between the Lucas Black character and the ex-kid from Home Improvement, and continuing with the Janet Jackson look-a-like who has nothing to offer but coy smiles and short skirts (not that there's anything wrong with that). What's worse is the fact that Lucas Black is cast as a 17 year old, when he looks like he's already in his thirties, and the Yakuza uncle character who looks like he's doing a very weak imitation of Don Fanucci from Godfather II. We were hoping for a little summer entertainment, a la Transporter 2, but what we got instead was too little action and too much posing. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this piece of garbage should be blacklisted from Hollywood. In fact, to say that this was worse than the worst movie ever gives it too much credit. It is the worst movie imaginable.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Not a bad film considering it was a Part 3;02.11.2006;True;"Usually when a film has a Part III, it leaves you with, ""Why did they make a third film?"" Case in point, ""Smokey & The Bandit"". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.

Tokyo Drift was a good film. Good plot line (if you disagree, then you're a ""Too much to think"" film-goer, stay with chick-flicks then). Good action. And of course, cool cars. The fact that it strayed away from Part I & II was a good idea. And film director, Justin Lin did an great job getting his vision to film. The mounted camera on a super-fast go-cart gave some spectacular shots.

It's a good escape film with the ""new kid in town, gets beat up or loses in some sort of competition, learns from a local to be better then wins in the end."" But for a trilogy film it's excellent compared to other Part III films that have been released."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;9;A girl's point of view;14.06.2006;True;I was fortunate enough to see an advance screening of the film last night. I'm not usually one to seek out action films but this one seemed different. First of all, the setting was intriguing. Secondly, trailer made it out to be a fun summer flick. And guess what? It delivers. I would strongly recommend this movie to be seen in a theater as opposed to DVD for one huge reason: the audience. I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater laughing, cheering, and gasping with everyone else. That environment is what these movies are made for. I loved the first fifteen minutes of the film. From the creepy pep rally to the metal detectors, the film was able to slip a little social commentary. The first race in the construction site was not only amazing but a great comment on capitalism. Even if the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the beginning it doesn't matter. The film flows effortlessly and what would have been contrived just feels real. I know these films get all the feminists all up in arms but hey, beautiful girls exist in this world and the way it's shot it never feels exploitive. Enough of the politics. Grab a few friends and try to watch it with a sellout crowd. You won't be disappointed.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;No rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining flick featuring excellent car racing;13.04.2017;True;"Branching away from any original cast members of the first two films, thankfully, Tokyo Drift provides a refreshingly new look to the franchise.

Tokyo Drift is possibly my favourite of the series, or at least its up there with the first film; it only has a few problems that can be swept under the ""It's Fast and the Furious, what do you expect"" carpet. The story follows American ""teenager"" Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) whose reckless driving lands him prison time, but to avoid this he moves in with his father in Tokyo. He attempts to move on a dangerous rival's girl, and must become a competitor in the street racing's drifting scene.

I say ""teenager"" as that's what IMDb says, and he does go to school in the movie… but honestly, he's the oldest teen I've ever seen. Along with every other ""teen"" in this movie! While I talk negatives, the majority of the film is set in Tokyo yet 95% of the dialogue is English and Sean has a knack of meeting every foreigner in the city. I don't mind this so much, but I fully expect all of the Japanese characters to speak Japanese, especially when Sean isn't present!

But, unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (choke) this film actually cares for its characters and their personalities (as Sean says early on: ""It's not about the ride, it's about the rider"") from Sean's fish-out-of- water acceptance, to his mentor Han's closet of skeletons. The villain isn't ridiculous either, his uncle is part of the Yakuza and he has a serious ""king of a little hill"" problem. Again unlike 2 Fast 2 Furious (gag) the cars have never looked better, sleek and refined and the drifting action is spectacular, especially when synchronized. Plus, no CGI, just skilled professional drivers, making the film worth seeing solely for the racing.

There's no stupid Tyrese Gibson mugging at the camera, no rats in buckets, no CGI, just an entertaining (albeit poorly localized) flick featuring excellent car racing and professional stunts."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;Enjoyable, much better than first two;15.06.2006;True;"I just came home from the drive in, i was looking forward to this movie since i have read some good reviews about it and also that I'm a car freak. A lot of people have been bashing this movie without even seeing it and bashing the idea of putting a RB26DETT Motor into a Mustang, i agree its not right, but it is just a movie and if you can get past that then you will enjoy it...anyone who loves the sound of a tuned skyline will love it. Keiichi Tsuchiya makes an appearance in this movie and so does Sonny Chiba, but i wont spoil the other cameo.

Justin Lin does a good job, the movie itself has great action scenes, awesome drifting and car choreography/stunts, the cars look and sound awesome, there are a couple of one liners that make me laugh (""Can i have a copy of that?"") you will know what this means when you see it and the babes....the babes are just gorgeous. Overall its a fun and enjoyable movie, far better than the first two.

Car lovers will like the movie but for everyone else....don't bash it till you've seen it, you might be pleasantly surprised."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;What?!??!?!;26.06.2006;True;Whoever voted for this so highly needs to be educated. The plot was absolutely horrible. How is a race going to settle the conflict? How did a busy Tokyo street completely clear up because he honked his horn. How did he learn to be the best at drifting in a few days when he was no where near a good racer as is. The whole crowd was outraged and laughing at the idiocy of the writers at this part, among many others. There was no depth to any of the characters. We barely saw any nice cars, although the drifting was nice. The whole movie was not tied together at all. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just leave it at this. Don't pay to see this movie. You will feel gipped.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Much better than the other 2;27.06.2006;True;Where do i start with this film? When i first heard this film wasn't going to have any of the original cast in it i felt rather disappointed but my opinion has totally changed after seeing it for the first time.The cast in it are great.Lucas plays his part well as does bow wow and the guy who plays Han. The things that stood out for me were the racing scenes mainly.There are a lot more than there were in the other 2 films and in my own opinion the races in this third are a lot better than any in the first two. The story isn't half bad either.I actually prefer this one to the 2nd film because of that as well as the racing. This is definitely a must see for all fans of the other two films though.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;3;Slightly Entertaining Movie with bad actors and worst story;24.06.2006;True;"This movie starts as expected and pretty entertaining, involving some street racing, and some 17yo who obviously doesn't fit in 'Sport America' and the whole high-school thing.

I gotta say, from the first time I saw the main actor, and he going through the metal detectors, I tried to imagine he was going to an airport, then a university, even with cheerleaders, football teams and all the cliché that comes with movies presenting high schools, I thought that, because they casted a 23yo guy that looks like a 32yo, I'm still actually having trouble believing that the actor is only 23 years old.

Sean 17 years old, played by Lucas Black, age 23, but looks 32, is the average American, with a slightly heavy, bad and annoying southern accent with a cowboy style goes to Tokyo after a race ends badly, there he meets with another bunch of 17yo who also look like in their late 20's, early 30's, and all have money, cars and lots of girls, including the main one, Neela, played by Nathalie Kelley, who obviously, gets disputed by both Sean, and his comic-book 'arch-villain' D.K..

The problem with the cast was with the choice for Sean and Neela, the first for being a bad actor and all of the reasons listed above, the latter because I think they injected her with so much botox, that except her mouth moving and eyes blinking and shedding some fake tears, you don't see any kind of facial expression whatsoever, the rest of the cast was good, even the Japanese playing the badly made character, D.K..

The story gets ridiculous from the minute Sean arrives in Tokyo, after school, he meets his demographically chosen friend and goes see the 'underground world of car racing', there he sees Neela again and from the start gets entangled in a love triangle involving the yakuza bad boy D.K., so, Sean challenges him for a race, oh wait, he doesn't have a car, no problem, some guy who never saw Sean before, or even knows his name, lends his 100k car, well, Sean trashes the car during the race, and that way, hey he made a new powerful friend, Han the Zen, all he did was trash his car.

Anyway, some scenes of Sean learning how to drift happen, over and over and over and over and over again, some flirting with Neela, anyway, he end up winning a race from one of D.K.'s drivers, after that some news happen, Han is stealing from D.K., so some fighting ensues, Hans gets f-cked and then Sean decides to go talk with the Yakuza master of the region, D.K.'s uncle, he gives the uncle some money and propose some peaceful solution, a race between D.K. and Sean, nevermind that the fight was already over, Hans was dead and Sean had nothing to offer, or was any kind of threat to anyone, but hey, this is a sequel, so, 3 Fast and 3 Furious, some racing ensues with a predictable ending.

One thing that was very enjoyable in this movie, was the street racing, those scenes were made in such a professional way, that one can only wish that the rest of the crew had the same competence, also those scenes remembered me a lot of Need for Speed, specially in the initial sequence, when some shortcut is taken, doesn't really try to distant itself when it puts some of the same soundtrack, which is also the only other positive point of the movie, of course, the producers had to ruin that also, the final street racing is by far the poorest, with all the curves looking the same, in the mountains, and some cellphones videos for some street racing fans.

Any, this was a very bad movie, with a terrible story and even worst main cast, but with some decent supporting cast, good soundtrack and excellent street racing scenes, but I still don't recommend.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;Adrenaline Rush - Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is a solid good third entry action flick!;24.01.2016;True;"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) in my opinion I think is a solid good action sequel, a very bashed and hated in the series. Which I don't think this movie is bad, I think is a much better movie than Furious 7. I always loved this movie, I think it is a good movie, but in the series is not the worst one, but is far from worst one that would be Furious 7. I think it was a different solid, good sequel in the series and I love it for an action film. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fun movie to watch: it accomplishes what it set out to do and that's provide the most realistic yet gravity-defying racing sequences, backed with the eye-catching background of the electrifying, neon Tokyo. Plot-wise it suffers a bit and the acting isn't top-notch, otherwise the loud music, import cars, cityscape Tokyo, and Japanese pop culture more than make up for the flaws of the film that you'll watch it again and again.

Plot: When convicted street racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) tries to start a new life on the other side of the world, his obsession with racing sets him on a collision course with the Japanese underworld. To survive, he will have to master drifting—a new style of racing where tricked-out cars slide through hairpin turns, defying gravity and death for the ultimate road rush.

This movie is more the highest-octane installment of the hit movie franchise built for speed! There are more mind-blowing stunts and heart-pounding racing sequences than ever, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift will put you in the driver's seat. ""Strap yourself in for a blistering, super-charged ride.""-- Pete Hammond, Maxim"" The CGI I am sorry but in one way it is terrible which I really did not like when Sean (Lucas Black) and Neela (Nathalie Kelley) are slide down with the car during the car chase and they cross over the crowd of people without hitting anyone, you can see the camera, that it is made with a CGI that is the only main problem I have with the film, the rest was okay. This is a very simple film, not a big confusing plot and again this films, you know 5,6 and 7 the plots are still pretty simplistic.5 was a heist movie, 6 was this guy the evil version of you, we want him to bring him down simple.7 you killed this guy's brother, he is looking for revenge and he also try's to kill you so you get this, simple movie not complicate at all. That is one thing that this movies get right constantly.

The racing in this movie: I think they did a better job than in 2, because I didn't noticed more of a CGI, because that's how they just do it now, a lot of wide shot you can tell there was a lot of practical stunt drive, it look good which I enjoyed that. I know a lot of people will put this movie lover down and I think it is a solid movie and a solid flick. This is the first time Brian Tyler made the score and this is also the first one that Justin Lin directed, he went later directing three next movies 4,5 and 6 which I love to death. I thought the direction is good, I like the resolves on the end of the movie, the sound track is good, I did not mind the cast you know. Lucas Black is the lead in this movie. Sonny Chiba is in this movie I always like the actor. This was Sung Kang's first introduction of his character Han who later appeared in 4 as a cameo, than in 5 and 6 as regular cast. Vin Diesel did returned with his character Dominic Toretto, who made a cameo scene on the end of the movie, which I thought was pretty cool. Bow Wow I didn't mind him in this movie and Nathalie Kelley was extremely hot and I really though she was much better sexy babe, than Eva Mendes was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Nathalie Kelley lights up the screen as Neela and I would welcome her return to the series any time.

Overall: Tokyo Drift gets a solid 8 by me it does lacks on the great characters and the cast of the first two movies in the series, but is redeemed by Han, awesome car scenes and a pounding score from Brian Tyler. I have enjoyed this movie and I think it is a solid action movie, I love this film and it is a step above than 2 Fast 2 Furious by me.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Refreshing and innovating;29.10.2006;True;"""The Fast And The Furious"" series opened the cinema for a whole new way to make car movies. This 3rd movie from this series added the cherry on the top of a sweet cake. Lots of action during the whole movie and, I must say, a very good argument. Way better than the 2nd movie with some characters very well created and also their evolution through out the movie.

Although, sometimes, it seams that the story walks a bit too fast and things happen too early, this 3rd movie has one of the best arguments of the 3. And I'm still undecided if it is better or not than the 1st movie.

Some really good change in this 3rd movie was the feature of drifts instead of pure racing (shown so far in the previous series). THAT is the main innovation in this series as long as in cars movies. The creators of ""The Fast and The Furious"" were PROBABLY pioneers in making underground car movies and they were surely the first doing a movie about drifting.

I must say that Tokyo was indeed a very good place to film this kind of driving.

Just to finish, I just wanna say there's a great surprise at the end of the movie!!! ;)"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Decent, Hardly any substance, But Sometime to watch :D;01.08.2006;True;"What can I say about this movie that many haven't already noted? Well first of all I saw this movie twice, and probably shouldn't have. The cinematography was phenomenal and the racing sequences were jaw dropping. Unfortunately, this movie lacks substance. The storyline was really iffy and probably not likely to happen and the acting was a little shaky.

But thats not the reason why everyone goes to watch this movie. We all go to see the cars and the girls which fortunately delivers. Beautiful cars, beautiful ladies and beautiful scenery and destructive driving is never in short supply in this genre and the scenery of Japan is just breathtaking. All in all, just a movie you'll want to see with the boys."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;"""One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.""";08.07.2004;True;"FILM: 7.0 Rewatching the 2006 film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, I find myself enjoying it more than most people seem to. So, here's an unpopular opinion: Tokyo Drift ties as my third favourite film in the series. The film ramps up the fun straight away, ditches the cheese of the second instalment, and goes for an original plot.

One of the aspects I appreciate most about Tokyo Drift is its unique setting and storyline. Shifting the focus to Tokyo and introducing the world of drift racing feels fresh and exciting. The races and chases are some of the series' best, with a kinetic energy that keeps me engaged throughout. The soundtrack is another highlight, with its thumping beats perfectly complementing the high-speed action.

I know people heap crap on it for not keeping it in the ""family,"" but it's an undeniably fun ride. The absence of the core characters initially feels strange, but the new cast manages to hold their own. Lucas Black as Sean Boswell brings a different kind of protagonist to the table, and I find his journey from outsider to drift racing aficionado quite compelling.

The character of Han, played by Sung Kang, is a standout. His cool, mentor-like presence adds depth to the film and makes for some memorable moments. The Tokyo setting is visually stunning, and the film makes excellent use of its locations, showcasing the vibrant cityscape in a way that's both thrilling and immersive.

What I like about Tokyo Drift is its ability to balance the adrenaline-pumping action with a story that feels grounded. The film doesn't rely on the over-the-top stunts that the later entries in the series do, and that simpler approach works in its favour.

Overall, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a fairly positive experience that brings something fresh and exciting to the franchise. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it to be a fun and engaging film that stands out in its own right.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;The drivers, the cars and the Drift races are the real stars of this movie , well directed on Tokyo location;08.04.2008;True;"This is an exciting narration of drifting auto racing with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets. It deals about a rebel American adolescent named Shawn Boswell(Lucas Black as a determined race-car driver) challenges his contender for a race cars, causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph through streets. To avoid the jail, his mother(Lynda Boyd) sends him Tokyo where is his father(Brian Goodman) as US military. Meanwhile the newcomer Shawn tries to ingratiate with Twinkie(Nathalie Kelley) and the world of racing in Japan, and hoping to join his extended group. In Tokio he discovers the underworld of the Yazuka and competes against Drift kingpin who is niece of mobster chief(Sonny Chiba who does a credible job).

The picture mingles action-packed,drama, exciting pursuits cars, suspense, a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. Flashy, noisy race-cars set in the Japan by the producers, -the famous Neal Moritz-of first part. Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage. Special cameo by Vin Diesel and appearance by Sonny Chiba, a Kung Fu idol of the 70s. Justin Lin's direction(previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas. Justin Lin is directing the third part with Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. The movie gives new meaning to the term ¨Tuning¨and ¨Drifting¨. The flick will like to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for cars fonds."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;MOST UNDERRATED OF THE SERIES!!;17.08.2024;True;I absolutely love this film, it moves over to Tokyo where instead its just pure speed we get the taste of the drift makes it kind of Need for Speedish. The protagonist is quite forgettable but we are introduced to Han and the best racing to date.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;A new cast in a new city;17.12.2015;True;"This film may be part of the 'Fast and the Furious' series but, apart from a brief cameo, it features an entirely different cast. Instead of being centred on undercover cop Brian O'Conner it follows teenager Sean Boswell who is sent to live with his father in Tokyo after destroying his car in a street race. His father forbids him from having anything to do with cars but it isn't long before a classmate introduces him to the local 'drift racing' scene. Here he has a run in with DK, the best racer and nephew of a local Yakuza, who isn't happy about Sean talking to his girlfriend. Sean challenges him to a race and DK's friend Han Seoul-Oh lends him a car… which he promptly destroys; if he is going to race he will have to learn how to drift. Han teaches him how to drift while Sean works for him to earn the money to pay for the wrecked car. It isn't long before DK and Han's friendship ends when it becomes apparent that Han has been skimming money. This ultimately puts Sean in his sights; Tokyo isn't big enough for the both of them; a drift race down a treacherous mountain road will determine who stays.

At first I was a little bit disappointed that the character Brian O'Conner wasn't in this as the first two films were about him. New character Sean Boswell is entertaining and Lucas Black does a good job in the role even though he looks too old to be in high school… I can't think why they didn't make the character older as that would have also have avoided the ludicrous idea that an American teen who doesn't speak a word of Japanese would go to a Tokyo high school. Still this film is all about the characters racing their cars and the race scenes are exciting; this is particularly true of the final race down what looked like the most dangerous road in Japan. The appearance of Sonny Chiba as DK's Yakuza uncle was enjoyable and a cameo from a familiar character should leave fans very happy as the film comes to an end. Overall I enjoyed this as good mindless fun even though it is weaker than the first two films."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;UNDERRATED Movie ! Totally;24.09.2020;True;This is the only movie about cars racing and after this they are only fighting between each other . Why this movie do not earn more at box office i don't understand. But for me this movie is best in franchise after fast five.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Furious' will have hearts racing;15.06.2006;True;"As expected, it doesn't take long for ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" to hit the gas.

As the film opens, we meet Sean (Lucas Black), the new kid at a Southern high school who's harboring a need for speed. After Sean ruffles the feathers of a resident jock (Zachery Ty Bryan), a scantily clad girl suggests, ''Why don't you boys let the cars do the talking?"" And so the adrenaline rush begins.

''Lost in Translation"" with a driver's license, the third installment of the popular franchise takes its car chases and souped-up engines to the Far East. Fans of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker will miss the tough-talking duo, but the mean streets of Japan deliver some action-packed goods.

Of course, don't expect more than a load of eye candy and the regular rumbles. The flashy drama begins when Sean is shipped to Tokyo to avoid jail time and live with his strict, military officer dad (Brian Goodman).

Making nice with the tough crowd, the American befriends Twinkie (Bow Wow), an army brat with a car that looks like it came straight out of ''Pimp My Ride."" It isn't long before Sean is taking test drives with a new set of wheels, not to mention getting on the bad side of the mafia-affiliated DK (Brian Tee) and falling for his girl, Neela (Nathalie Kelley).

Directed by Justin Lin (''Better Luck Tomorrow""), ''The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" is injected with testosterone and saturated in masculinity. Branded a gaijin (Japanese for foreigner), Sean tries to master the driving skill of drifting while trying to impress his crush and settle the score with DK and his crew. What's the best way to solve the world's problems? Racing, of course.

Sure, it's not the wittiest, smartest or most memorable piece of cinema. But the film delivers everything it promised: loud music, loud cars and a whole lot of glitz."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;"Horrific excuse for product placement. Neither ""fast"" nor ""Tokyo""";05.10.2007;True;"I'm an American who has lived in Japan for most of a decade. I can honestly say that this film, supposedly set in Japan, is entirely untrue to the real Japan. Fashions, culture, economy, language... all are wildly misrepresented or simply ignored. You will feel that this is a ""version"" of Japan cooked up by a Californian 9-year-old.

The film also plays on patently insulting false stereotypes: 1) A black high school junior hoodlum who (impossibly) sells stolen goods openly at school, has a driving license, and drives his own heavily decorated new car; 2) Everyday high school women who are impressed by racing, and will literally offer themselves to the most impressive driver around; 3) A mafia boss who agrees to settle a major dispute with a foreign ""nobody"" by racing rather than ignoring the moron or shooting him; 4) a dirt-poor ignorant American ""kid"" who manages to get an expensive car free from a new friend, master racing in a day, ruin and rebuild cars in hours with a budget of nothing, and capture the hearts of every babe he sees; 5) ...and a whole high school of thin model-like kids who have no jobs, don't study, own $100,000 cars, and wreck the cars nightly.

The film is an insult to you, the audience. Do you really want to pay a dozen dollars to watch a nonstop car-and-iPod-and-sneaker commercial that ignores the real Japan, insults women and black people, and has not one believable plot element? Vote with your $, and say ""no"" to this horrific swill."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Improvement over the previous installment;26.07.2019;True;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is an improvement over the previous installment. Lucas Black and Sung Kang give great performances. Justin Lin's direction is great and the new location breathes new life into the franchise with some of the best car chases yet, even if the plot is nothing new.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;A slight departure for the franchise.;20.12.2015;True;"When teenage road-racer Sean Boswell (Lucas Black, who is too old for the part, but hey-ho) gets in trouble with the law for a third time, he avoids a jail sentence by going to live with his father in Tokyo; there, he becomes involved in the drift racing scene, coming to blows with DK (Brian Tee), the nephew of a powerful Yakuza.

Tokyo Drift gets short shrift from some Fast & Furious fans because it steers the franchise away from the US street racing scene and because it doesn't star series regular Paul Walker. While it might be a slight step down from the previous entries, being a little too teen-centric with its predictably troublesome high school protagonist, I don't think it's all that bad. As a fan of all things Japanese, I can appreciate the colourful Tokyo setting, the Yakuza storyline, and, of course, all those oriental cuties in extremely short skirts.

Director Justin Lin, who went on to helm parts 4, 5 and 6 in the series, handles the car scenes with aplomb, each race shifting up a gear in terms of adrenaline-pumping action. Drifting—sliding the car around sharp corners at high speed—adds a new level of excitement to the action, with a mountain road finale offering plenty of nerve jangling, edge-of-the-seat moments. The film closes with the reappearance of a familiar face, paving the way for further instalments."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Silly performances (aside from Han's) but, wonderful drift scenes!;16.01.2021;True;"With great racing scenes, silly action scenes and generic performances, ""The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" offers what is more than necessary for fans of this franchise and fans in love with tuned cars."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;"""Tokyo Drift"" Charts A Change of Pace";17.02.2014;True;"""Better Luck Tomorrow"" director Justin Lin's ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" qualifies as a departure from the norm for a franchise. First, the action takes place in Asia instead of Los Angeles. Second, until the ending, we don't see anybody familiar. Although the hero is a misunderstood misfit, he isn't anything like the major characters in the previous films. Lucas Black plays a high school kid who is attracted to trouble, but he isn't a professional thief or a public servant. As Sean Boswell, he winds up in Tokyo and has to prove himself in an entirely different culture. Inevitably, our hero clashes with the nephew of a Yakuza boss played by the legendary martial arts superstar Sonny Chiba. Lin does a terrific job orchestrating some complicated action, especially the scenes where drivers drift. The drifting here, particularly during a town race, is breathtaking stuff. On the basis of its stunt driving, """"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" ranks as a good movie. Of course, the Chris Morgan screenplay is shallow, but he fills the action with interesting characters. Lucas Black is terrific as the fish-out-of-water hero. Brian Tee makes a first-class villain as TK, while Sung Kang is appropriately laid-back and cool as a glacier. Superior stunts, adrenalin-laced races, and a sympathetic protagonist make this ""Fast and Furious"" installment a breath of fresh air."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Action packed testosterone, cars and chicks. But don't try this at home. :);10.07.2006;True;"I expected no less and no more than what I got: Vin Diesel, fully using his newly acquired love for Shakespearian acting, gives us a performance of style and finesse. Too bad that's only in the last minute of the movie.

In the rest of the movie, hot head teenagers race for no other reason than adrenaline overdose, using top class Japanese cars in Tokyo. The story is pretty weak, too, but if there are people that get turned on by cars, this is a porn movie, and they don't really need a story.

For a movie placed in Tokyo there was a suspiciously low number of Japanese actors with actual lines. The cute Asian chicks appeared only in a few scenes, then ""drifted"" away. Lucas Black, with the same accent he has 10 years ago when he played an annoying kid in American Gothic, has now a big pack of extra muscles and a winning smile.

Conclusion: fast paced car movie, nothing else, really. A few free Japanese lessons now and then and a very peaceful representation of the Yakuza. And the disclaimer in the end felt so funny when my heart was beating faster against my will from the speed racing and it said ""everything was done in a controlled environment, don't try this... blah blah blah""."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Really good film.;05.06.2013;True;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the least popular of the Fast and Furious franchise but it's also the most underrated. While I thought the country accent was a little overblown and some of the cgi looked a little too obvious, the movie was really good. The plot is fresh and exciting, the acting is spot on, and the cars are great. That's honestly one of my only gripes with 2 Fast 2 Furious is that, while really entertaining, it got away from the car element quite a bit. This movie brought back the cool car factor that made the first film so special. Overall, while it wasn't as good as the first two, it was still a great movie in its own right and one that can stand alone without the others.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Gotta love the drift!;02.11.2006;True;"Judging by the majority of the comments I'd better explain myself and why I like this movie. Sure the acting isn't that great and the storyline is a little hard to follow and hard to believe but tricked out rides are the stars in the franchise of the Fast and the Furious. The first one had the nation going crazy because it showed everyone the world of street racing. This is why I can appreciate Tokyo Drift because despite the acting and the iffy storyline it introduces another element of street racing, drifting. Before this movie if you mentioned drifting to the average person they wouldn't know what you were talking about. So I like the movie because it concentrates on the racing theme which is why people went to see it. I know it's a movie so there has to be a storyline but sometimes it ""drifts"" away from racing too long...sorry couldn't resist the pun. As for the totally new cast, it didn't bother me because as I've said the cars are the real stars in movies like this, it doesn't matter who drives as we've seen in the previous two films. It gets a 7 for the awesome racing scenes in Tokyo, they keep you interested enough to sit through the blah blah blah that is everything else in the movie."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;3;Worst of the trilogy;22.05.2020;True;The first movie was good, the second not so much...this one is terrible. The main actor has to be one of the worst I've ever seen, he sounds like Forrest Gump and his 'acting' is like a child at a school play. The cars were good and some of the women nice to look at so if that's what you're here for you'll probably enjoy it.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Like finding a pristine Z in the garage with a seized engine...;20.06.2006;True;"First, I am a car guy. So at least one of those stars is simply from the fact that it's a car movie with good vehicle exposure. That being said, I went into it thinking I'd see a weak attempt at milking the franchise, and was pleasantly surprised to find a plot, character, and development. FF3 has it's warts, but it ain't half bad and I'd recommend it to anyone into the car scene.

Now for those warts. First and foremost, the car racing scenes are gratuitous and CGI'd: it's a movie though, people, so get over it. They look cool, even if in some cases, whomever was responsible should be taken out and flogged. The laws of physics *can* be obeyed and still permit the production of a good racing scene. Acting was excellent, which has always impressed me in this franchise where I expect something more along the line of Mischief 3000. So kudos to casting and directing.

The plot in this (no spoilers!) is weaker than a head gasket on a 1960 'vette been in a barn rotting for 30+ years. And what makes it worse is it didn't have to be. Hire me, boys, I can fix your flaws! But still not so weak I couldn't watch it. I am not appreciative of the plot vehicles they are using to draw these people together, though. You do not have to bring the movie down by utilizing undersirable character flaws. Seriously, call me, I'll walk you through how to make a better movie without the weak plot.

The hunnies are nice, but barely adequate to anyone who's attended a good car show. They need more camera time. The lead actress Nathalie Kelley is fiiiiiiiine. But she got enough time.

The cars were the real loss on this one. No time was spent in even cursory discussion about what chassis, what engine, what tweaks. That's why we come, boys, to see the cars. There are some really nice cars, just not a lot of time spent on them. I couldn't even identify a couple they were so modded, and that's a shame. Going to have to buy the DVD with the extras disc to find out more, I suppose.

All in all, more fuel for gear heads. And Tokyo looks great; I can't wait to get a look at those hills up close and personal."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Ummm....OK I guess;19.06.2006;True;"Going into this movie I had the lowest expectations ever. I mean Bow wow is in it. Couldn't they have gotten some better actors like Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, like in the first two? No, they got Bow Wow. Well I went in with very very low expectations and walked thinking it wasn't too bad. It was an o.k. overdone action movie I'll give it that. The acting was quite cheesy and the movie itself was predictable. But at the same time it did have some very nice(nice, not possible) racing scenes that I did enjoy. Another thing was that I totally didn't feel the fast and the furious ""feeling"" throughout this one, as I did during the first two. It just doesn't quite follow the same theme and guidelines. But its a guaranteed favorite for all those die hard action movie lovin people, jus wasn't all that great with me."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;More of a comedy than an action movie;30.06.2006;True;The movie wasn't too bad, at least not as bad as some of the other movies that are still out. I didn't like Bow Wow's character too much. He seemed out of place in Tokyo and I'm not saying that just because he is not Asian. Twinkie, Bow Wow's character, seemed a little too...American for Japan. He had been living there longer than Sean, yet Sean some how managed to learn more Japanese than him. And Sean never did really get the girl. Sure, there were implications that they liked each other, but there's no romance in their relationship at all. My friends didn't really appreciate how Sean, a white man who had just moved to Japan, became the new DK or Drift King. And why was Vin Diesel in it exactly? What I did like about this movie is how funny it was. I'm sure the writers weren't aiming for funny, but my friends and I just found the entire movie hysterical. Like why was it that the whole entire school was into drifting? And there was this one scene where they were racing in a crowded street and everyone just somehow knew they were drifting and formed the shape necessary for the drift to occur. If you want a good laugh, this is the perfect movie from you.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;2;laughably stupid threadbare plot;05.09.2006;True;"An incurable addicted-to-speed young racer, Lucas Black, escapes to Tokyo to avoid jail after repeated arrests for racing. He joins his father, (who is estranged from his mother), in Tokyo where he runs into problems with other local race-aholics. The young American vies for the attention of gal who is linked to local Japanese racer, and the two rivals for affection eventually butt heads. This is the extent of plot you get in this tire-screeching, attitude and hormone churning, low-brow flick, where almost every character seems to be suffering from some form of personality disorder, or is just plain stupid. Somehow, in spite of a glaring lack of insight or smarts, the protagonist, a refugee from high school ""shop"" classes where he learned to work on cars, seems to master the Japanese language effortlessly. The Japanese characters in the flick are equally repulsive, or more so, as most are no more than thugs, with our hero's Japanese rival wrapped up in a Yakuza (Mafia) family. The movie is just a ""loser to bruiser"" story, as the young American masters the Japanese racing style, with flashy fast cars providing the backdrop for our hero's transformation. The movie does offer a generous supply of laughs, but I don't think that's what the director and company had intended."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Tokyo Drift.....drifting away from the plot...;28.06.2006;True;"First off, I quite liked this movie. For a movie that followed on the heels of 2Fast this is an achievement. 2Fast was just just lameness personified. Tokyo Drift, or 3Fast, as I will refer to it, was much more restrained. Sure, it had foolish plots, love story, fast, scalextric like cars and all, but it was less....stupid.

At least, for 90% of the movie. There are two things that really stand out as ""spit-your-coke-into-the-hair-of-the-guy-sitting-in-front"" moments.

Firstly, and right from the start, we are expected to believe that the lead character is 17 years old. This is the same trick that was pulled in Biker Boyz and it doesn't work here either. Granted, the age difference wasn't as great here, but the guy is actually 24, not 17, and looks nearer 30. Not good for suspension of disbelief.

Secondly, towards the end, having peed-off the local crime boss, the ""hero"" boldly goes into the lion's den to make amends and settle honour.......by suggesting a car race with the loser leaving town! I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but Sonny Chiba really did look completely non-plussed at the suggestion. You knew it had to happen...it's a car racing movie, after all, but it was just ridiculous. A car race to the death, or the loser having finger's cut-off.....maybe. But not leaving town! Beyond lameness.

There are bright spots, though. The racing is pretty entertaining, and they've done away with the ""hyperspace"" graphics when someone presses the nitrous button. There are a few scenes where the ""hero"", whilst learning to drift, thwacks a wall and the car doesn't show the damage in the next scene, but does at the end, but that is just down to bad editing. You'd think it'd be easy enough these days to CGI a few dents in for effect.

Also good was Sung Kang, as Han (not as in Han Solo, though he has some of the same qualities) who is by far the most likable of all the characters in the film, with his life-zen outlook and easy manner. He steals most scenes he's in, without really even trying.

And there is the obligatory cameo at the end from a certain former Fast and Furious star. Not sure whether this was to give the film some kind of ""legitimacy"" in the franchise, or to hint at his involvement in the inevitable next movie. Either way, an interesting little scene right at the end.

Overall then, better than the second movie by far, but still not up to the first one. But worth a watch, nonetheless."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;3;An abomination of all that is right in this world.;26.06.2006;True;"This is my first movie review. Prior to this, I had no intention nor any reason that would provoke me to respond to a movie by writing a review. I feel that if you are going to spend ten or twenty minutes of your life in front of a computer in order to deliver a message about a movie to random strangers, the movie has either impressed you and you want to extol the sheer brilliance that you have just witnessed, or the movie was so bad that you want to JUST WARN PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM IT! In the case of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this is a HUGE WARNING. If you have a moment, take some time to read ahead and explore the crapfest that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.

Much, if not all, of this movie is crowded with higher tier actors (Vin Diesel at the end is the only exception... and to be honest... he's not even that great of an actor.. he's just good at his static, one dimensional character roles which require minimal talent). Lucas Black (you know..... that guy from Friday Night Lights...) hardly does any real acting. And of course, Bow Wow tops the list of amazing and talented actors that make up this movie (let's not forget other classic Bow Wow movies such as Johnson's Family Vacation...).

Clearly, the script was written by a seventh grader. I see no possible way that a living and breathing human being can come up with so much horrible, gut-wrenching, cheesy, mindless dialogue. Some of the lines are also completely irrelevant to the ""storyline"" of the movie. They make the characters try to sound deep, but instead they created the biggest over indulgent piece of crap ever known to man. Ten minutes into the movie, and you'll notice the problematic script. Yet the dialogue, sad to say, is not the least of its problems.

The storyline. Man, wow............................................................ ............................................................... where do I begin?

Sean Boswell is a seventeen year old student who loves to race cars. Challenging the rich kid, he completely destroys his car and is just a short step away from juvy. Instead, he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father. So far, the plot makes sense. Here's where it goes wrong. Sean Boswell gets drawn to the racing world.... Then an hour of complete crap happens, he learns to drift, and he challenges the nephew of the local mob boss to a race, making it clear to his father that ""he has to fix this"" ----> yea.... I'm just as lost as you are, the dialogue doesn't help either. Then he wins the race (surprise surprise) and instantly becomes the new King of the racing world. Oh and guess what, he also wins the girl! no movie would be complete unless the guy wins the girl. Anyways, there really is no set plot here. A guy looking to stay out of trouble suddenly becomes the hottest thing in underground racing. Not to mention, the mob boss is a pansy. There really is no bad guy in this movie. You'd figure it would take more than a race for some seventeen year old kid to prove himself to THE MOB. Granted this goes down as a partial mob movie, it is probably the most inaccurate and stupid mob movie of all time.

Basically this movie comes down to good looking cars, fast paced action, and Asian cleavage. What the film lacks in consistency, dialogue, acting, and everything else that makes a movie great, it tries to make up for in tight Asian skirts and huge breasts.

What gives this movie any hope for a great review is the fast paced racing scenes. If there is anything Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has done right, it's the racing scenes. I must admit, they were pretty entertaining to watch.

Yet that still does not make up for the poor acting, horrible script, and senseless/ridiculous plot that is The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Had the filmmakers polished up some of these areas, this film might have a fighting chance for a good review.

However, right now that is not the case. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is a horrible abomination of everything that is right in this world. So far it has prompted a loser like me to sit here at one o'clock in the morning and issue this review/warning to avoid this movie at all costs. Period."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;Tokio Drift is a very good film;14.03.2021;True;For everyone who likes action and car films Fast and the Fourious Tokio Drift will be very good for you. The story is well written and the actors are doing their job well. In the film are a lot of car races.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;"Tokyo ""Drift""";30.08.2020;True;The only interesting part of this movie is the drifting. That's all. The cast is fine but the depth of the character is just meh (except for Han who had a good motive). The story and plot lack some tension, especially the Yakuza part. Why the hell Yakuza was described so weak in this movie.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;Well, it was fast and it was furious - but it wasn't very good;08.08.2006;True;"Now it is time again; for the third time racing drivers drive furiously and recklessly on the streets - racing for things like power, prestige, money and women. While Tokyo Drift may sound like 'just another movie about cars', it is much different from the previous two Fast and Furious installments, shifting from the hot streets of Californa to Tokyo, Japan. The protagonist is no longer surfer-boy Paul Walker, but Lucas Black as 17-year-old Sean who always escapes his problems by moving away.

But Sean decides to stay in Tokyo this time to deal after gets entangled in a dirty Yakuza mess when he races against a Yakuza boss's nephew, and steals his girlfriend (unforgivably annoying Nathalie Kelley). The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) thus sees American Sean and his crude ways juxtaposed with the sleek technology of Tokyo. It is an effective contrast, and the Tokyo background provides visual stimuli throughout the film, elevating it above generic formula.

But ultimately, this is ALL that is good about this film because the acting is atrocious - not any of the leads should ever be allowed to act again, even with better writing. The exception and stand-out performance in Tokyo Drift is the sexy Sung Kang as the guy who takes Sean in when he comes to Tokyo, and teaches him in the ways of 'drifting'. However, I have always seen the Fast and Furious franchise as an elaborate excuse to parade fast cars and fast women, and Tokyo Drift is no different here."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Tokyo Drift;03.04.2015;True;"Now let me state I haven't seen it in a long time so I'm going by memory of how I felt about this film.

The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third film in the series and unlike the first two films it doesn't have the original cast members which is a let down since it's normally wise to have the cast reprise their roles for the films.

But for the story for this film it just makes you understand why they went to a new cast.

The plot centers around an American Teenager Sean Boswell (Played by Lucas Black) who gets into trouble with the law after a street race with an high school kid so to avoid going to jail he is forced to move in with his father Major Boswell (Played by Brian Goodman) in Tokyo, Japan.

But old habits are not easy to bring as he begins to rival with Takashi (Played by Brain Tee) who serves as the film main Antagonist, the feud begins when Lucas begins to chase his girlfriend Neela (Played by Nathalie Kelley).

What most fans would be disappointed about the film is that the film features no of the original characters.

But the film plot is interesting but still feels kind of let down considering. Plus we first see Han in the series

The action scenes and taunts are good for the film despite it flaw acting but it just a hard film to not talk about.

The film is just hold back for many reasons but if you're a fan of the series give it a watch.

I give The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift an 7 out of 10"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Lacking compared to the others;04.08.2019;True;This Fast and Furious entry sits down near the bottom of the franchise. It's not bad, it's just not particularly memorable for anything other than its title maneuver. Lucas Black has nowhere near the charisma of the franchise's other leads and the story is ultimately pretty bland.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;I watch this film at least 4 times every year;01.02.2021;True;Not a huge fast and the furious fan but this is a whole other entity genuinely 15 years old now and still holds up the nostalgia is something else reminds you of great times - plus has one of the most iconic sound tracks of any film I've sent every song is spot on I just absolutely love this film and I hate cars
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;A Nutshell Review: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift;28.06.2006;True;"The Fast and the Furious franchise relies on the simpleness of 2 factors to attract an audience from boys to men - sexy cars and fast babelicious chicks, topped up with plenty of testosterone and adrenaline in overdrive. Racing cars of all makes, be they the European, American or Asian models, one thing's for sure, the stunt driving team deserves all the credit. The first movie made a huge star out of Vin Diesel, while the rest had relatively smaller shots at glory, from Paul Walker, who returned for the second, to babes like Eva Mendes, Michelle Rodriguez and Devon Aoki.

The third installment decided to insert refreshing elements, and set itself in the land of the rising sun. Presumably influenced by the driving technique called drifting, which made it to mainstream consciousness via the Japanese manga Initial D, it's just too bad that the Hong Kong movie by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, adapted from the manga, got to it first, like almost a year ago. Perhaps if the latest shenanigans of racers from both sides of the Causeway were widely publicized, this film could even be made closer to home! (In case you're wondering, the Malaysian police had recently conducted a dragnet rounding up illegal racers on its North South Highway. Flashy cars with raunchy stakes - the winner gets to take home the loser's chick for a night's worth of lurve)

There will be no doubts, comparisons between the East's Initial D, and this one from the West. In my opinion, this one edged out Initial D. There are many aspects in which Tokyo Drift is superior, and naturally having a bigger budget means that the filmmakers can afford to put more cars on showcase, more cars involved in races, and more races in varied locations like a tight car park, on the streets of Tokyo, and as a homage too to the source, they couldn't miss the mountain range. Scenes were for both day and night, unlike Initial D's predominantly night scenes.

It's never about the acting, though Tokyo Drift will lose out in terms of having relative rookies helm the show throughout, unlike Initial D's stellar supporting cast of Chapman To, Anthony Wong, to established popular teeny-boppers like Edison Chen and Shawn Yue. But Tokyo Drift did have veterans like Sonny Chiba lend a hand, and the coup was the casting of Keiichi Tsuchiya, the original inspiration for the manga, in a cameo.

Taking over the lead role from Paul Walker and Vin Diesel is relative newcomer Lucas Black as Sean Boswell, a good for nothing troublemaker with the inborn need to speed. He comes from a broken home, and is the root cause of his and his mom's moving from city to city, because he cannot get out of trouble from the law. When the final straw broke the camel's back, he gets sent reluctantly to live with his father in Tokyo.

Thinking that the Asian city has nothing to offer, before you can say ""drift"", he finds himself drawn into the world of underground racing, with plenty of flashy cars, hot chicks and mean Yakuza-linked punks itching to challenge anyone to a race. As clichés rule over this movie, Sean falls for the Drift King's (Brian Tee) main squeeze Neela (Nathalie Kelly, thought she looked like a cross between Paula Abdul and Rosario Dawson), while unwittingly got brought under the wings of Han (Sung Kang), business partner of Drift King, who teaches him the true meaning and purpose of drifting (which is a no-brainer purpose of snagging hot chicks).

Anyway, to a gaijin, Sean is ignorance personified, from culture to racing, he takes these challenges head on, stupidly. And surprise! A movie like this offered some one-dimensional character development of troublemaker turned good, who learns the meaning of brotherhood, although fame did get into the way of course. But herein lies another strength against Initial D, the lead did not turn out to be ""all powerful"" - here he has to learn the basics of drifting in an incredible short period of time, and turn out well of course, at the expense of expensive tyres, and cars (always a pain to see them being wrecked).

Any racer worth his salt must pimp his ride or zhng his car, and this one offered no less. The star attraction in the franchise are the vehicles. From the Nissans to the Mustangs, it seemed that the Mitsubishi Evo will be a mainstay, and the hero always drives one. It's almost a no- brainer to film movies like these, having stunt drivers to do the actual stunt driving, then cut to actors looking as if they're driving, and insert multiple cuts of hands on steering, foot on pedal, looking mean, etc. Instead of just incessantly focusing on drifting, there are the standard zig-zagging car chases, and some usage of Nitro for that quick boost of horsepower, which the first two movies frequently used.

Given its ending by an uncredited cameo which will send fanboys of this franchise into highs, this movie still has potential to be relatively popular and the franchise can indeed continue. It wouldn't be far out if there's an announcement of The Fast and the Furious: North-South Highway, and yes, you heard it here first! So race away, and unabashedly indulge in this movie that makes no apologies for being fast and furious to the loud sounds of its contemporary soundtrack!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;I just left the movie with blood springing from my forehead;13.07.2006;True;"I went to watch this movie with a friend who's really into tuning and cars all in all. I haven't seen the two previous movies, but since this really had nothing to do with the others I persuaded myself to see this...and, well my friend didn't get anyone else. I knew what I was about to see. Fast cars, nice chicks and some throwaway male-lead. Little did I know...

I hadn't read the reviews since I really didn't care about this movie. But I guess it was supposed to be a good popcorn-flick. My friend is broad in the shoulders so I was uncomfortable in the seats throughout the movie. Having to lean left the complete movie I was a bit cranky after wards.

But I had my popcorn and Pepsi. So I was happy for about ten minutes. Ten I started paying attention to the actual movie. My god did I make a mistake. I should have bought a boatload of popcorn and have a heart-attack instead of concentrating.

Lucas Black has the...he has no skills. He's f***ing terrible.(I don't know if I can curse in here.) He looks dull, he smiles horribly, he speaks like he's had a brain surgery gone bad and I have no idea why he was shown shirtless for the 15 seconds he was shirtless. Jesus H Christ, is this guy Turkish? A couple of times I laughed out loud since his acting was so bad. He was so terrifying that it wasn't even funny. And the price chick? I have no idea why I disliked her but still I did. Guess I had high hopes of a pretty Japanese girl in lead.

Now, I'd like to tear the script piece by piece since the characters where so unlikeable and the plot so...pointless is the word...but I won't. I'd like to see Erich from ruthlessreviews.com do that. They're so much smarter than me. But I have to give the climax some credit. The whole deal dumb and pointless(again). I wish they had fought for the girl instead of driving(no spoiler, it's predictable). Seeing Lucas Black shot after winning(of course he wins, is there a possibility he won't?) the race would have been more than satisfying. Possibly after that brought back to life and taken to that place in the movie Hostel.

So guys and girls. Don't see this movie. Instead, choose Genius Babies 2, Crossroads, Gigli or painful death. Something with heart.

So after we left the scene of crime my friend asked me what were my first thoughts. I said I wanted to kill him.

Ps: With the budget they had, they could've had someone else instead of Mr Black. With lesser, still they could've. Why the hell did they choose Mr Black?!!!!???"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Deeper and darker;11.05.2023;True;"Justin Lin's film is deeper and darker than the first two episodes of the saga.

With actions followed by consequences and a sense of responsibility to be developed in order to be able to turn mistakes into learning opportunities, the plot is enriched with a deeper pedagogical meaning.

Last but not least, the violent and shocking death of one of the film's characters, as well as the warning message at the beginning of the end credits, concerning the professional qualities and the strict safety standards necessary to make the film, remind us that driving in the public space must never be a mindless act disrespectful of the highway code, which protects our health and our life."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Pleasant time pass entertainment;12.10.2019;True;Pleasant inoffensive entertainment makes for enjoyable time pass. More oriented towards the younger lot with stylish cars lovingly photographed and an old fashioned storyline. A huge improvement over the previous film.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Overhyped;17.02.2024;True;"Watched this like 18 years after its launch and was overhyped to the point of making it a religion.

I am a weeb, so I understood some of the words like gaijin (meaning tourist or outsider). After watching it I also realized that DK had no traits that make him a compelling villain, the main character's gf (Beth?) just said ""Oh we went to Touge to watch kids drift until we got out rides and started drifting together"" and ""DK used to be so nice and kind before, until he started to assimilate himself into the yakuza world"". Which is such a lame ass backstory for someone who became the MAIN ANTAGONIST! He was given the worst treatment a character ever gotten, he only existed to be a villain, not a man who became the villain."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;2;I'd rather eat my own head, than see this again;24.08.2006;True;"Well, not literally, really. I went to my friend's birthday, and this film was showing in town, i with four other friends(who happen to enjoy films like this) decided to go to this flick. The closer we got to the theater, the more i couldn't shake the feeling, that i am doing something so wrong, so satanic and amoral, that burning the bible would seem like saying a prayer at dinner.

But i just couldn't leave out, as this was the birthday boy's idea and he paid for the tickets. I must also note, that to of those friends had already seen the film about three times or so.

Now, to talk about the movie itself. It's bad. It's so frigging' bad. Why is it so bad? Oh, well, let's start with the acting. Our leading man, Mr. Lucas Black gives one of the most dreadful performances in years, to say the very f*****g least. This movie guarantees him a career of mindless and dull action crap, for sure. Or maybe that's what he wants? Heck, if i knew. Nathalie Kelley tries to be the mysterious hot chick, but fails miserably at what she tries to reach. The only man who saves the acting, possibly the whole movie, is Sung Kang. His character, Han, is so slick, so cool, that you can even believe an actor this good signed on for a movie this bad. Saying this movie is pointless is putting it mildly.

As i said before, two of my friends had seen the movie before and knew all the lines to it by heart, if they even have one. So they were saying the lines of the actors before the actors themselves could say them. I couldn't believe there are people so tasteless in this world. After this tale of unbearable horror ended, my friends loved and decided to go for a second watch. So, i had to go too. After this experience, i simply wanted to kill and tear apart, not only my friends, but everybody else who liked this movie. Yet, i still gave this movie a 2. Why? Because of Sung Kang. He earned this movie the 2.

As i mentioned, my friend paid for the movie, so no money of mine was wasted, and that's the best thing that happened through this awful experience.

Do not see this film."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;The music and racing is great;30.11.2021;True;This movie and music is amazing in this movie. Im not sure about the main character just because his voice can be a little annoying but you get used to it after the 10th time watching it. It is definitely not the worst but not the best but the music and the drifting is great.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;watch it again in 2024 !;04.06.2024;True;"Watched tokyo drift for the second time after 18 yrs yup i enjoyed it ..even more i ithink its one of the best of the fast and furious series .. FF 1 , FF 2 and tokyo drift the other in the series just too many gimmick

In tokyo drift they have: no CGI normal car with a good modification.... normal person as a driver not a secret agent man or super soldier... no such thing as a ""family"" more believable story than the other in the series , no car vs tanks, no car vs submarine , no car going to outerspace just car vs car so please make FF series like this ..about race + nice car and speed................."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Fun Action Flick;12.08.2018;True;Probably the most 2000s movie I've ever seen. From the way too digital look, to the heavy metal music, to those great slow-mo shots that we all love, Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift might be so bad that it's good.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;4;Who green lighted this?;21.04.2007;True;What an incredible tour De force of crap. Of course I didn't care for the first two movies in this series. However I do like cars and racing. Why not just make a good documentary about street racing? Having lived in Japan for 3 years the idiosyncrasies are over whelming. For one Tokyo has some of the heaviest traffic 24/7 in the world. Maybe they could drive like that at 3:AM for a few blocks, but not how they show it in the film. I will say the cars were great and so was the driving. The girls were hot too. Sorry but the story was disappointing at best. His little hip-hop sidekick was annoying 5 seconds after he showed up on screen. The acting was total garbage as well. If both of those kids were military brats, why didn't they go to the American school on base? Do you know how hard it is to learn Japanese at 17 or 18 years old, and do well enough to keep up in school? Give me a break! This is a great looking movie, but fare from good entertainment. The story line is weak as water and the characters are paper-thin.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;I just love it.;12.03.2021;True;I don't know why. But this movie hits me every time. It so good. A real feel good movie. A bit over the top, but that's one of its may twerks. Think the office - but as a action movie.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;A Third Installment that Fits In;23.03.2025;True;"Watching all of the Fast And Furious movies that have come out it makes sense where Tokyo Drift is going.... You will understand if you watch all of the Movies that they have made. This third installment is great it makes sense with the other movies great cars, drifting scenes are amazing and the appearance of Vin Diesel at the end made it better. Like I said before the movie will fit in as soon you see the others, and that is what I liked about this movie, the movie develops so good and it tries to be this over the top drifting movie until the end of the movie, the acting is great and the racing sequences are really well made, I would is the weakest on the franchise but still deliver, great 3rd installment. I give "" The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift "" a 7 out of 10 Stars."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Not that bad!! Underrated!;19.06.2023;True;While the film didn't have as much action as the other ones and while I wish Vin Diesel wasn't just shoehorned in at the end, I still had a fun time with the plot and confrontation/rivalry between the protagonist and antagonist. It was also cool how it was eventually made to be tied in with other films in the franchise. The main character had a pretty decent origin and while it is far fetched that he would be sent to Japan after he committed a big crime in the U. S., I thought it was a good and unique spin on things. The chases and races were really well directed and choreographed too! People are too harsh with rating this one!
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;An honest, real review;16.09.2019;True;"I'm gonna be Real Honest here. Love fast and furious movies,they're fun to watch, so was watching them all again, and can't help myself now but have to comment on this movie because it is sooooooooooooooo annoying thinking about the fact someone, or more than one person, actually got paid for the casting in this movie!?

Nothing personal against Lucas Black, not saying he's a bad actor, but what kind of mentally challenged guy or team of people thought he was the right fit to play a 17yo troubled teen in this movie????

I mean seriously?? Whoever payed anyone to do the casting for this movie, call me next time in stead to cast ur movie and I will do a million times better for free...

Picking a 35year old looking guy to play a 17yo kid (with a terrible southern accent)... It blows my mind... Again, not judging Lucas Black, if someone would pay me a lot of money to play a 15yo girl in a movie once, fk it, I will do it too.

But I'm a 34yo man, I am not right to play that part! I'm writing this review in the middle of watching the movie, and going to finish watching it now.

But will still be so annoyed the whole movie long watching some 35yo looking dude struggling to act like a 17yo kid...

Really worst casting ever, they might as well had anthony hopkins play the main charachter, would've been just as believable."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Better then I had expected.;10.08.2006;True;"First of all, I loved The Fast and The Furious. It had an interesting undercover cop story with a little illegal street racing flavor to it. Of course Vin Diesel's character Dominic Toretto stole the show and as soon as I found out 2 Fast 2 Furious had Paul Walker starring and no sign of Vin Diesel I knew it would suck big time, and it did. I hated 2F2F because of how they dumbed down the story into something I could write within a matter of hours. My little brother got the DVD so I checked out the deleted scenes and what do ya know! they had cut out some scenes which would have made it a bad movie instead of the piece of crap it turned out to be.

As soon as I heard Dominic Toretto would make a cameo appearance I wanted to see Tokyo Drift. Yes I wanted to watch a full feature film just for the 20 seconds we got to see Dominic Toretto. But aside from the bad actors like Bow Wow (why not just use another rapper while we're at it) the story came back to the franchise! I went to see this movie with expectations lower then those for a Steven Segall movie but I was wrong! Dead wrong because a lot of things The Fast and The Furious had were back with a Japanese twist to it! Once again the main character starts out as an incompetent driver and eventually turns out to be one of the elite. Also, once again there's a girl involved! And once again there's some actual killing going on. Not that that made it a better movie but 2F2F did feel like they wanted to keep the rating as low as possible. If you liked The Fast and The Furious then your going to like this as well. No it's definitely NOT better but at least now they could close the trilogy without a big flop like 2F2F."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;Very Insulting;30.04.2009;True;"I wonder is there anyone here actually from Japan and were they also insulted by this movie? Not even being Japanese, I found these movie greatly insulting to the Japanese culture. I have never been in Tokyo, but in my university I have met many international students, including some from Japan. And the girls that I've met were very polite and educated, interested in classical music and literature. In art, history and politics.

And then some American director makes a movie showing showing Japanese high school girls in barely any clothes and high heels, but what is even worse is that they are pictured as completely brain dead. Their only pursuit in life is to look better than the other girls in order to get a boyfriend who is the fastest drifter. In the movie they don't even speak. But of course, they don't have any thoughts or ideas, they just need to show off their legs, right?

It is just as insulting to Japanese male teenagers. Their only interests of course consist of fast cars and girls. There is no existence of science, art, music, sports. The world consists of metal containers with rubber wheels that use gas in order to move. And that is the greatest love and passion of all humans.

It's also funny that those teenagers in the movie are in high school and yet spend most of their time discussing cars, looking at cars, racing cars, buying cars, anything else that has to do with.... cars. Funny because one of my Japanese friends also had a comment about that and he said that in the final grades of high school, as he was going into science, he had to take Biology, Advanced Physics and Calculus with multiple variables. He, very unfortunately, did not have the time for drifting and in fact did not even have time for a car at all. A very sad reality it was."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Entertaining;04.10.2006;True;"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) is a very entertaining addition (the 3rd film so far) to the ""Fast and the Furious"" films. While most sequels tend to be inferior to the originals, I found this one very refreshing and unique. Expertly directed by Justin Lin, this movie is definitely style over substance, but a great style it is! When you see the cars ""drift"", you are in for a ride (pardon the pun!). So while the story and script are unoriginal, and the acting by Lucas Black as the lead character Sean Boswell not up to par, it's still a must-see - at 7 out of 10.

P.S. - Watch out for a welcome ""cameo"" from the first film!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Great car racing, okay everything else;10.08.2019;True;The car racing in Tokyo drift is fairly realistic, definitely exciting, and takes up more time in the movie than it's predecessors. Which is refreshing, seeing as the basis of the movie is racing cars. The plot is a little thin, in that there really isn't one for the majority of the movie. The last few minutes it pulls something together to end the movie. Acting is a little subpar, the main character is a bit dry, but it doesn't detract too much. Don't go in expecting an Oscar worthy performance and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the quality of action.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;All that NOS just eats your brain cells away... but who cares?!;16.06.2006;True;"Intense would be the perfect one-word summary for this movie, similar to the original Fast and the Furious.

The funny thing is however, the plot just seems to keep getting worse with each sequel that the F&F series pops out.

In this one, Sean is your typical teenage truant who gets into loads of crap for all his street racing antics. He's sent to Japan to live with his soldier dad and there he's assimilated in the Japanese underground world of... DRIFTING! If you plan on seeing this film, prepare to leave your brain at the door because the plot here is almost non-existent and instead prepare to be hammered with an excessive amount of EYE CANDY.

Hot babes, hot cars, a hot city and hot lead characters will fill your eyes while Sung Kang (Better Luck Tomorrow) delivers a terrific performance that adds some much-needed humanity and drama that has been lacking with its predecessor.

Still not as good as its first older brother, but definitely better than its 2nd bro. Go see it, summer's finally taken off!!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;Finally, a Fast & Furious for the weaboos!;17.06.2024;True;"The third chapter in the original Fast & Furious trilogy is the last car-centric film in the franchise, this time focusing on the car culture of Tokyo. It succeeds in being a love letter to the city, but changes the formula for the franchise too much in ways that don't work.

An attempt at returning to the Teensploitation type tone, Tokyo Drift feels like a stand-alone film but is actually a monkey wrench in the Fast & Furious timeline. Han is easily the best character and is the only one to join the family in other entries in the series. The other characters are straightforward stereotypes without the cheesy charm of past leads like Diesel and Walker.."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006);16.06.2006;True;I just went to go see (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift)on it's opening night in the U.S. it was OK. The same fast cars, fine girls, crashes. The old character's are gone but a character from the past 1st shows up at the end, if u liked fast and the furious or 2 fast 2 furious go see it but don't expect it to better than the 1st or 2nd because its not and anyone will tell you that but if u are a fan fast cars, hot girls - may i say Asian girls- go see it. If your asking is it worth the money or the time the answer is yes. Is it something thats gone blow you out of your seat the answer is no. I rate it six because it doesn't stink but its not amazing but its better than average movie.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;What a load of crap!;07.08.2006;True;"I have absolutely nothing good to say about this complete crapload of a movie. It lacked plot, dialogue, and anything that makes a good movie. The only way you'll find this movie good is if you sleep through it. Please, I beg of you, do NOT waste your money on this load of crap. This movie is basically directed at adolescent boys who have no sense of what on earth makes a good film. Now, that's not to say that ALL adolescent boys are like that; but if they are, they'll love this.

You want to know what this is about? Here's the whole story:

Kid gets into trouble a lot. Kid moves to Japan. Oh look! It's 200 barely dressed women! Oh look, an explosion! Hey, let's race! Oh look, an explosion! Oh dear, someone died. Hey, 200 barely dressed women!

The End.

Explosions and hot girls make up this supposed ""movie."" Every five minutes I was forced to watch another stupid freaking race. NOTE TO THE PRODUCERS: IT GETS OLD AFTER THE 900TH TIME THEY RACE.

Do NOT see this movie. You're better off watching ""From Justin to Kelly."""
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;9;The best F&F movie of all time !;16.03.2021;True;"By far, the best car movie i've ever watch in my entire life !

This movie takes place in Japan and shows lots of cars especially from Japan such as the Nissan 350Z, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX, Mazda RX-8, and many more Japan cars. This movie not only talks about Japan cars, but also talks about the Japan life such as the Tokyo's underground street racing, Japan night life, the school life in Japan, and Yakuza. Different from other fast and furious movie which shows about a heist movie with pretty cars, Tokyo Drift is made for car enthusiasts. What I like about this movie is how Japan people spends lot of time and money for their cars and do races with the cars they build. This Japan cars is mostly known as JDM cars which lots of car enthusiasts love them. The races the do in this movie is very intense and interesting to watch.

In conclusion, this movie is made for car enthusiasts from all around the world who love cars very much, especially JDM cars. I highly recommend this movie because I love cars so much ! From 1 out of 10, I would rate this movie a 9/10 !"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;For some sick reason, I actually liked The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift;04.12.2007;True;"I just saw the first two Fast and the Furious films a couple days ago and I had this gigantic fear of watching Tokoy Drift, I wasn't into the first two films, and this seemed like another guaranteed let down. But since I rented all the films simultaneously, I just wanted to get my money's worth, so I watched The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift this evening, I have to say that I was totally surprised. Even though it was typical and the plot was predictable, I still liked this film a lot better. I feel like this was the story that they should have started out with, it seemed a little more realistic. Well, most of it anyways, not to mention the killer ending they had, but I won't spoil. But The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a great story and an unbelievably good looking cast, you can't help but love it.

Sean has just raced the toughest jock in high school and well, you guessed it, they got hurt doing so. Since the jock has a good connection Sean is in trouble for it, his mom doesn't know what to do with him, so she does what any sensible parent would do, she sends him to another country! Japan, to be with his navy father, but he quickly discovers the under ground world of ""drifting"", which is actually racing, but it sounds a lot cooler, doesn't it? But he gets involved with the good guy who vs. the bad guys who belong to a Japanese mafia, and falls for the bad guy's girlfriend and they race each other, you know how the story always goes.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is typical and silly, but for some reason, I really did enjoy it. I think it just had a better story. Either that, or I figure maybe I was just in a better mood when I watched this film opposed to the other two films. But I did enjoy The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and would recommend it for mindless entertainment, after all, this has cars and good looking people, what young person could ask for more? Well, I'm sure there are many different things I could ask for, but I got my hour and a half's worth."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;indulgent popcorn fluff;25.06.2006;True;"Rev head Sean has been in trouble with the law for awhile. Hitting his third strike when racing through a construction site, he's shipped over to Japan to live with his father. Instantly on the wrong side of everything, it's not long before he's back into the racing world, introduced to a different style of racing; drifting, using the tightly constructed car parks for races. To full of himself, Sean takes on DK; Drift King, using DK's business partner Han's car. Losing the race and smashing Han's car, Sean becomes in debt to him to pay for the car.

The whole of the Fast and the Furious franchise is all about the spectacle. Glossy, fast paced action, great cars, hot women, an abundance of over indulgence. The spectacle is what made the franchise so interesting and so popular. Slapping together a story line to serve the action and badly written dialog are easily over looked, only to the extent that you deliver some amazing action sequences. Director Justin Lin has on account delivered some amazing action scenes. The energy and adrenaline run hard and fast, with tyres screeching at ear piercing levels. This does run off set pieces; the chase through Tokoy city is one great example, leaving you just waiting for the next piece to arrive, though the down side is you have to sit through terrible acting and plot ridden story.

When your characters are so broadly drawn and one dimensional, you don't give your actor much to go on; yet they aren't that talented in the first place. Verging on Grease levels of older actors playing teenagers, Lucas Black doesn't have much strength to carry this as the lead Sean, walking around with a stunned mullet. Sonny Chiba comes off cartoonish as a Yakuza boss. Brian Tee lacks menace as DK. Sung Kang does the best performance as Han, not taking his role to any real serious level.

If you start to think about all its inconsistencies or take this serious for even a second, it hurts your mind. It's a piece of entertaining popcorn fluff."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;An Average By The Numbers Action Movie;22.02.2019;True;24 October 2006. This movie did what it was designed to do - show of fast cars and a little bit of female legs for the young men going to see this movie and make a little profit for the producers. This predictable movie without much more provided the typical thrills and melodrama that any tame male macho movie is supposed to, except for its more exotic locale - Tokyo - which is used to a degree. While the plot is mostly straight forward and the action decent, there isn't much else, except for a small attempt at avoiding a fight scene and a weak attempt to introduce Japanese culture to the American movie scene or vice versa. The chase scene that includes lots of drifting unfortunately was handled in the most obviously set up way with cars set up in patterned, artificial ways so that safety came first (while essential) really made the movie look cheap. The character development of course was flat, the relationships nothing special, the integration of Japanese culture only mild - not much new or learned here. Just a fast-paced, not even that sexy, a movie that at least held together decently. Five out of Ten Stars.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;It's actually alright;30.03.2014;True;"American teen Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) gets into serious trouble street racing. He is set to go to jail, but then he is sent off to live with his military dad over in Tokyo. His dad's rules are to go to school and don't drive. Almost immediately, he breaks the second rule, makes an enemy of D.K., and gets in debt to Han (Sung Kang).

Lucas Black is a good solid actor. It makes up for the fact that most of the film had none of the original cast. Sung Kang who would go on to play Han in other F&F movies is very effective. The same cannot be said for Bow Wow or Nathalie Kelley. It's mostly Bow Wow who sticks out like a sore thumb, and it has nothing to do with him being black. The cars are pretty like always in the franchise. The drift driving is interesting for about a minute. The chases have been done better. There is a bit too much CGI in the chases. The one thing that is great about this movie is the Japanese locations. It's nice to see the franchise really go to Tokyo."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;I didn't get it.;31.12.2013;True;"I was so excited to see the next F&F....that being said, the first 75% of Tokyo Drift had some moments, but for the most part, I was bored with it. I could never buy into some of the characters (ie the main girl, I forget her name) which made it hard to take in the movie as a whole. The story line was there, but it just didn't do it for me.

The ending was pretty cool. From the final race to the ending with the cool Dodge (and who was in it). A sequel without any of the regulars doesn't make sense.

This should've been a movie by itself, not of the Fast & Furious kingdom. Maybe I would've liked it a little better....maybe not.

I gave a 6 of 10 just because it had the hot girls and hot cars, otherwise, it underwhelmed me."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Not award winning material, but decent.;19.06.2006;True;"Lets get one thing clear, you are not going to a Fast and Furious movie for the groundbreaking plot and acting, you go for the cars, the racing, and the babes. Tokyo Drift is basically the same if not a little better than the previous two as far as the racing is concerned. There is the street racing that the series is famous for but also the addition of drift racing, which adds a new bit of spice to the flavor. As I mentioned the acting and the plot are so so at best, not something you will be groaning over but not enough to really drag you in and connect you with the characters. However it is my opinion that the plot here is better than in the second movie.

Lucas Black from Friday night Lights replaces Paul Walker as the main character here, and Bow Wow is along for the ride as the trusty friend/sidekick. A few cameos from other actors and movies are thrown in as well. From beginning to end this movie does hold your interest with the racing, and for that the weak plot and questionable acting can be forgiven. Cars get wrecked, punches get thrown, loud music is played, and the hero has to do what he thinks is right. Bottom line, if you enjoyed the previous two, or even enjoy car racing movies at all you should get some entertainment value out of this one. Not the best movie to ever grace the silver screen, but I had a good time."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;i dunno wt film u watched;26.06.2006;True;"okay so most people are expecting another version of the original two. well its not, its a whole new kinda racin. so don't go in expecting to see straight roads. and yeah the film takes a while to get going, but its all info that u need to understand the film.

Tokyo drift, still has the cars the all the thrills that the other two had,but in a slightly different way. so don't set your mind on the ova 2, and spoil it 4 yourselves.

i say its worth while going to see it in the flicks cause u ain't gona get the entire impact of the film on ur own t.v i hav to say that the small surprise at the end is brill! but hey you'll hav to watch it!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;For Once Take The Movie For What It Is!!!!!!!!!;26.06.2006;True;"DAHMMMMM!!!!! For once would you people take a movie for what it is??? Why does every movie that does well on this site have to be a groundbreaking, heart touching, and life changing experience??? The one word to sum up this movie is ""great"". If you love great looking, suped up cars, hot women (especially hot Asian women) this movie is for you. The action in the movie was basically non-stop. There was always a race or chase or something happening to keep the movie flowing. It was never boring and you always were waiting to see what would happen next.

Of course there is some cheesy dialogue and a tiny bit of weak acting here and there but its a great action movie and especially if your into cars.

Even my girlfriend who I had to basically drag into the theater enjoyed it a lot.

The icing on the cake was Vin Diesel's cameo at the end. It was great to see him back behind the wheel and I hope that maybe he would be interested in doing another fast and furious with him starring in it.

Simply for what the movie is, its a great movie. I wish this would have been the sequel to the original because if it was I think the series would still be a strong and popular franchise.

So all you people who are giving it bad reviews and low rating need to have there head examined. You all need to stop thinking your Roger Ebert and for once enjoy a movie for what it is!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;2;Stylized street racer;14.06.2006;True;"Follows a similar theme to the previous two, but character development is marginally better. Babes and cars as fabulous as always, female lead is to die for. Anti-heroes all ridiculously over the top, when we all know REAL hard-core criminals are discreetly deadly. Hero slow to learn and doggedly persistent in his ability to get himself in trouble. Not good but we're into cars right? At least there were no insulting gobbledygook ladled with 'tuner' terms that made no sense like the first one.

Racing is as unrealistic as the previous two (when your opponent is catching you, change up. Again.) but some spectacular driving moments could be picked out from the stylized pap, watch out for the drift into a ramp and the top-of-third on-the-limiter full opposite lock moment in the streets.

I thought it bad, despite the fantastic Tokyo backdrop and the girls making me want to go jump on a plane from the cinema, but I'll probably put the DVD in my collection next to the other two when it's released. What can I say? I'm into cars :)"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Not Bad Not Great;07.06.2020;True;Overall rating 6.4: The third film is definitely the black sheep of the franchise. I don't mind Sean in this movie but I would've liked to see Paul Walker in this film. I liked Vin Diesels cameo in the film and I think it was a nice touch. The film isn't as exciting as the previous two instalments and I think that Takashi is a pretty mediocre villain. The film does have some good race scenes but the movie lacks solid characters making for a ok 3rd outing.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Better than F2!;24.07.2020;True;"Without any of the original cast members I wondered how this installment would play out. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it more than '2 Fast 2 Furious'.

The premise and the characters were much better than it's predecessor. This standalone sequel had lots more action than F2, and the action sequences are stunning! I cared more about the characters, and thought the actors did them justice with good acting. With the lack of comic relief that was just too much in F2, this was more serious and therefore more suspenseful.

The events leading to the finale was well set-up as it built to a climax. By that time we knew the characters, and there's been great character development - especially from the lead, Sean (played by Lucas Black). Off course the stunning cars are back - more impressive than F2, and the film has a great rocking soundtrack for most part. The stunts are jaw-dropping.

The finale was a thrilling, fast-paced visual spectacle. The film has a highly effective score - especially during the finale. Everything about this film was better than F2. Wow, this was incredible. I loved it! This is a darn good action film!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;High-octane direction makes it entertaining;22.06.2006;True;"Shawn is a young delinquent with a habit of getting in trouble due to his driving habits. His latest offense has him going to Tokyo to avoid jail time. It isn't long before he meets up with the car culture there and gets an embarrassing taste of drift racing by losing to a local champ who also has connections with the Yakuza. Soon Shawn is drawn into the underground world and a predictable, but stylish summer-fare ensues.

The story here is one you've either seen before or will comfortably predict. Also, when going to see a second sequel to a franchise that is all about cars, what can you really expect? Nothing too spectacular on either story or action side of the film, but this is a surprising strong entry to a series, seeing that it is number 3 of course.

The acting is decent with the clichés not being to overplayed or outrunning themselves, but rather just acting as connective tissue for the film's main event - the breakneck racing scenes. Which is exactly what the first film didn't quite reach and what the horrible second film in this franchise seriously lacked.

The racing scenes here are possibly the best in the F&F franchise with a high octane direction that makes them very exciting to watch. They incorporate a lot of interesting shots - both CGI and real-life - mix it in with slow motion and all sorts of pans, which is then topped of with some frenetic editing and a hard rockin' soundtrack. That makes for some good fast- paced summer fun. 7/10

Rated PG-13: violence, frenetic action, and some profanity"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Fast and Furious: Karate Kid;05.03.2022;True;"While the story won't win any awards for originality, the car race choreography and action cinematography is truly amazing, all with mostly practical effects.

While Lucas Black does not convince as a teenager, the other actors fare well despite their stereotypical parts, and the setting makes for some spectacular set pieces.

A nice change of pace from the others in the series, and a good standalone movie in its own right."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;2;well, that went well I feel;14.04.2009;True;"So, after two crappy movies the film execs whipped out their calculators and did the math 100 hired bimbos + souped up kit cars = $50 and a bag of cheese Thousands of horny teens + flashing lights = £100 million gross.

So, a third movie then, only with a twist. This time our erstwhile middle-aged teen hero is off to Japan, where Tokyons drive their car sideways it seems. You can't shake the impression that if they just braked going into the bend and accelerated out of it they would get round them quicker, but oh well.

Anyway, on with the plot. The story starts with a race between clapped out banger (driven by the 30 year old teen protagonist) and some meat head given the stupidest ultimatum ever by his bimbo girlfriend ever. ""Race him for me"" to paraphrase. Rather than give his fickle bird the bird , hoiking her out of the car and driving off into the sunset he acquiesces and so ensues a pointless race around an estate, where much property is destroyed.

As our main man begins to overhaul the expensive sports car in his fred flinstone vehicle, the blonde bimbo whines ""I thought you loved me"". Not for her the more traditional displays of affection, oh no. Her boyfriend does his best to demonstrate his love, smashing her and car face first into a cement pillar.

Such criminal violations by all are duly punished by the exile or our hero to Japan where he meets his 40 year old dad (damn gina, he was a real mover in the creche). After this our teen idol is enrolled into a Japanese class. Mercifully, all the Japanese jpop stars and av models speak passable English, but as luck would have it a 50 cent knock off and an ozzie supermodel are also in attendance, bringing great relief to the the focus group no doubt.

Surrounded by hot totty in short skirts our main man does what any other teen would do, quickly ignoring them and instead driving his car sideways, at first badly, but after a week or so better than anyone else in Japan, particularly those who have been driving their cars sideways for years.

I kind of lost interest after this (as well as the will to live) to be honest. There was a pretty cool party at one point (three guys, 50 hot girls in zero tolerance clothing - arranged by Carlsberg no doubt) but since teenman seemed more interested in going to the basement to look at a crappy bike, my eyes glazed over and my brain disengaged.

After a while a Japanese Al Capone makes an appearance and by the time I stopped laughing it was the final race. I won't ruin it for you (if you have a brain cell I don't think it would be possible to anyway) but I would just say that the symbolism of a crappy mustang racing a Japanese car was not lost on me (Go USA eh?) but the middle-aged teens hooting and hollering at their mobile phones was bewildering. Beyond product placement what the hell was that about.

To sum up, stupid, garish, unbelievable, pointless, too much stupid sideways car-driving, and not nearly enough hot Japanese teens in minimal clothing. GAh!"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;9;Legendary;28.07.2023;True;"Is it even possible to have hate towards this movie?

You have an action movie about a troublesome teen who's life literally depends on cars. Gets into a parody of a gang war and have to beat it's boss in a race ,while fulfilling his manhood by winning the respect of a mafia boss and the woman of his dreams.

It's the perfect movie to represent what the feeling of being a man is ,combined with some fantasy action and sad moments.

The plot: 9/10. Interesting ,new, attracting, revolutionary for it's time

The acting: Many of the actors are pretty much unknown from other movies ,before this one , which proves how good they did their job, for unprofesional actors."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Closer the first one, much better than the second.;06.09.2006;True;"There should have been the first movie and then this movie. There shouldn't have been FaF 2, which was not very good at all.

Tokyo Drift is decent... so OK they got an actor that's not far off from Paul Walker (or Keanu Reeves), but they've basically completed the import car scene by taking it to where the import cars come from. Japan. Storyline is of course not realistic nor is it feasible where the first of the series, Fast and Furious, held its own. But it's not completely bad like the 2Fast 2Furious, which was successful anyhow because of the cars and actions sequences.

The visual effects are beautiful in this film and the action/drifting sequences are second to none when it comes to artful stunt driving sequences. The professionals do a great job with the cars, you get to see popular spots of japan and the art of drifting racing through some crazy stunts, such as when they drift up the spiralling driveway in the parking structure.

The characters weren't challenged in this film so, acting was minimal and rhetoric was shallow but it wasn't about the actors and storyline, but about the cars and the action."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;A side story;26.09.2020;True;"This review contains spoilers.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is the third installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. It is a movie that stars a new cast of characters that engage in drift racing rather than the previous two movies' conventional racing. The movie follows Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black, that is exiled to Japan following a street race that lands him in jail. Sean shortly after meets Han, played by Sung Kang, who teaches him drifting and the two form a friendship.

Surprisingly, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift has a coherent story. This is a welcome change from 2 Fast 2 Furious' incoherent story. The movie follows Sean and the audience can see his journey as he tries to make things right with Han and his own father. The story and the characters are the good parts of this movie as I was engaged to find out more about Han and the drifting culture. The downside is the villains are not intimidating. I did not find them engaging and it felt that it was only a matter of time until they were overcome.

The cast of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are not present as main cast members in this movie. This can be a disappointment to fans of the previous two movies as the two actors can be charismatic in their roles. This movie did feel less like the previous movies and more of a side story. The movie felt plausible in its execution of stunts and for this the movie can be enjoyed as a side story set in the same universe as the previous movies. The story keeps up the light-hearted fun of the first two movies but can delve into interesting plot turns. Han is a great character and I enjoyed every scene that he was in.

I would recommend The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Although the movie is not perfect, the movie is a complete stand-alone movie in The Fast and the Furious universe.

Grade: C"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;"Very Cool ""Drift""";25.06.2006;True;"""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" stars Lucas Black and Bow Wow (grown up Lil' Bow Wow). There are no stars in ""Tokyo Drift"". Then again, the true stars are the ""rice burner"" cars racing through the streets and parking garages in Japan. None of the characters from the last ""The Fast and the Furious"" sequel made the trip to Tokyo. So for Director Justin Lin, he has a formulaic story by Chris Morgan populated with attractive heroes and villains, fast cars, and hot women in a very polished package. Here Lin and Morgan use the exotic locale to highlight the underground extreme sports culture of drifting in Japan. Lin and Morgan also provide insight into modern Japanese culture itself—unexpected and provocative. In a stylish signature scene Japanese young people at night stand along the winding downhill road of the climactic race, send and receive video camera images from each other via their cell phones. Brilliant. Director Lin effectively tells his story through captivating imagery.

Shawn Boswell (Lucas Black) is a 17 year-old constantly in trouble for racing muscle cars at school. As the movie opens, his latest run in with the law could land him in jail as an adult. Instead his mother negotiates to have Shawn live with his father in Tokyo. His Dad, Major Boswell (a good Brian Goodman) tells Shawn the house rule is ""No racing"". Shawn attends a rigid Japanese school with the mandatory uniform. It is all very high tech, wireless laptops in the classroom. Every kid has an iPod. Shawn hooks up hipster Twinkie (Bow Wow), who introduces him to the nocturnal world of drifting. Shawn would like to hook up with the beautiful Neela (Nathalie Kelly), but she is with DK (Drift King played by Brian Tee). Shawn loses a race in an inept display to DK. However, in the process Shawn gains a mentor and friend in Han (Sung Kang). Han is DK's business partner. DK's uncle Kamata (Sonny Chiba) is Yakuza. DK is someone not to mess with.

From the totally ignorant and fascinated perspective, this is a simplistic take on 'drifting'. You have lightweight high torque cars capable of 130 mph with soft tires for turns. In drifting the driver accelerates the turn with the parking brake engaged. It's kind of like self imposed chaos. You are in control when you are totally out of control. Though DK is the Drift King, Han is the Zen master of drifting. Han confides in Shawn ""It's all about trust and character."" Sung Kang has a presence and ease as Han. Han tells Shawn during his training that he is going to have to figure it out for himself by doing, ""There is no 'wax on, wax off'."" Justin Lin captures the adrenaline rush of extreme speed, and the amazing impassion of the drivers. Lin also paints a fascinating picture of this drift culture metaphor. The Japanese kids during the day wear their pressed uniforms, and attend their classes without question. All is ordered and structured. At the drift races, the girls wear their pimped out Britney Spears clothes, and the guys have their spiked out hair and tatts on display. All shiny objects. Fast high tech cars. Hot girls. All rebellion. Here Lin is all style, and it works. There are no real surprises in terms of story in ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". Relative newcomer Lucas Black is charismatic and believably pulls off Shawn. Nathalie Kelley is gorgeous and charming in the card board cut-out role of Neela. And remember to stick around till the end for a surprise from Lin. ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" will not win awards—it is just very hip and very cool."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Good racing sequences get lost in a movie with too much talk and similarities to other films.;25.06.2006;True;"High school kid who gets caught racing one time to many is sent off to Tokyo to live with his father. There he finds himself mixed up in the Japanese underworld and racing once more in the ""drifting"" style.

This movie has great car sequences, some good characters, some nice lines of dialog and by all rights it should have worked but the film frequently loses sight of whats going on its own world and so we're left to twiddle our thumbs.

After a good set up to the story the action moves to Japan. Our hero's dad lays down the law he's to go to school and not race. After an initial run in about staying out late the film jettisons the notion that anyone is in school or that the kid has a curfew and concentrates on the characters and the romance. This would be fine, except that after 20 minutes of set up there really isn't any sort of racing for about 40 minutes (I know I checked my watch). From that point on the film shoots to its conclusion in a rapid and entertaining fashion. Unfortunately the the damage is done and you're not as fully engaged as you should be. Its not bad, hey I didn't walk out, but its not what it should have been.

I have to say that the one thing that really bothered me about the movie is that the film is very similar to the Chinese film Initial D, especially in its climatic race. Actually it seemed like a mobbed up version of Initial D with violence added to the story of racing. Its not fatal, but if they wanted to remake that film why change so much of the story?

Worth a look on video or cable. Not worth 10 bucks in theaters."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;3;Cinematic Noise;17.06.2021;True;"The third film of The Fast and the Furious was cinematic noise. It was just engines revving and an obnoxious soundtrack that was used to tie together a flimsy plot and generally unlikable characters. It was a sequel that did not feature any of the previous actors (except for a cameo at the end) and could have easily been a straight-to-DVD film with little connection to the original. It was properly due to the film being shot in Japan that forced it to be a cinematic release. The filmmakers were even able to find a lead that was less charisma and acting ability as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.

The Tokyo nightscape was nice and there was some decent race sequences, but it not enough to redeem Tokyo Drift. It's amazing to think that Justin Lin and Chris Morgan were able to turn The Fast and the Furious into the juggernaut it became."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;cars in the rising sun;29.06.2006;True;"Mark Kermode always warns against seeing films which are based on computer games. Theyare all meant to be awful without any plotting instead relying on brand recognition and glossy producing and a couple of good looking women. Go back and watch Citizen Kane then. This is fun, rookie driver with dark past, we've heard it over and over again for 60 years ""I'm troubled, I let someone down"" so we know where we're starting from. He goes to Japan to take part in a lame macho, genital waving affair of motor racing. The usual dichotomy of good and bad guys who fit clear personality types with no ambiguity as usual. Then the cars do their thing and thats what you've been waiting for. I and some others ended up seeing this as a result of the actress Ashika Gogna and another who had been used as a part of a painting by the actor and scientist Stephen Armourae. Knowing her had an eye for a good thing (or what he likes) I gave this movie a go, it was a pleasant surprise that despite all its clichés it was entertaining and if cars are your thing you sure will be happy. Plenty of handbrake turns and snarling bad guys trying to crash our hero"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;Need for speed: Underground;21.08.2006;True;Sean Boswell is an American having passion for car races. Once a time when this passion sends him out 2 jail in-order 2 escape this he goes 2 Tokyo 2 live with his father and study there. But his passion is boosted there by illegal street races. He thinks 2 crank-spot the races but to find Drifts as his disappointment about which he knows nothing. There r neither drags nor sprints but drifts where the driver has 2 curl through very sharp turns retaining his balance with his speed & balance. So Sean tries his luck 2 learn the styles from his rival's friend. He loves his rival's girlfriend which makes the thing worse.Now how he succeeds and gets his love that's the story. The overall movie experience was pretty good. But the plots is not the exact sequel of its former versions.The story also charges as it's all about racing. There is no story in it. the film gets dull sometimes but then it keeps u engaged. But it has not lived up to the mark as its predecessors. The environment is exactly the same as in the game NFS:Underground 2& Most Wanted released by EA Games. If you like the race winds & Japanese chicks then go and take a look at this. Still I'd give it 7 outta 10.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;9;Glossy, exciting bubblegum for the eyes and brain;18.08.2007;True;"The third installment in ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is possibly the best so far and was a pleasant surprise. I went into this film with low expectations but was genuinely thrilled by the film. As a devoted petrol-head, it doesn't take too much to start my heart pounding and the sight of the automotive pornography portrayed here certainly did the trick.

Lucas Black takes over from Paul Walker as the lead in this high-octane thrill ride. Black's portrayal of car-fanatic Sean Boswell is spot-on. Scrumptious Nathalie Kelley is the female interest in this film while the bad guy is played by Brian Tee. The cast also contains Brian Goodman as Black's father, Sung Kang as Han, and Bow Wow as Twinkie. While most of the cast made me feel positively ancient, I still found the film involving and high-gloss entertainment.

The numerous effects are beautiful, the Japanese scenery and backdrop is awesome and the whole film looks polished.

I personally can't wait for the fourth installment, especially given the rumours of Vin Diesel's interest in it! 9 out of 10. An almost perfect sequel and worth viewing just to see the cars."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;It's either you like it or hate it.;16.01.2023;True;Despite its flaws, I'm still enjoyed Tokyo Drift to this day and it is still one of my personal favourites from this franchise. This movie felt like it rather take it easy and simple, but sometimes, simplicity worked better than being convoluted most of the time. The action sequences are a lot better than before, especially the last race segment. There's fair share amount of hot babes, if that's one of the the things you expect from this movie, and the score are probably the best in the franchise, in my opinion. Some of the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical though, especially the MC, the script is predictable and felt familiar at times, and the fact that this sequel is almost completely different from the other entries might throw people off.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;Solid awesomeness;01.01.2020;True;"A really fun extravaganza of drifting and exciting soundtrack throughout! Quite under appreciated Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift is great for what it is definitely deserves highly than 6.0; plus Lucas Black is entertaining I think it's nice to see him grown up after Sling Blade."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Upon the fourth viewing of this film, i realized............;16.10.2009;True;"This is actually a highly underrated movie. However, in order to realize this, you have to first look beyond the surface- which in essence is a 90 minute long music video. So once you've pulled that off, you can see that this is perhaps the most well made one of the franchise. Yes, it does have sub-par acting for a majority of the movie, but you don't watch these for the acting, you watch them for the cars- and it delivers in that aspect. And yes, Lucas Black's hick accent does come on a bit strong, but I later realized it helps add to the fish out of water motif throughout the movie. As I mentioned before; this is a well made film, especially in the way Justin Lin captured elements of it: it keeps your attention with eye-catching visuals, fast cars, and a wonderfully tone-setting score composed by Brian Tyler. Also, unlike the first two films in the franchise, I find this one to be highly rewatchable. So lets face the facts and view the movie for what it really is: 90 minuets of fast, furious fun."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;This one finally had something;30.12.2011;True;"Fast and furious 1 and 2 were one of the most awful car action films ever. Mostly the third one followed similar route but it was better in many ways.

Plot was again pale, perhaps a little better than it predecessors had but still. Some action, some criminals, a non interesting love interest - all familiar from the previous films. There really is nothing to enjoy in that sense.

Dialouges and characters were little better and so was acting.

What makes it better was simply drifting. Now we could really enjoy some driving skill too. Some of the scenes were pretty technical and not very easy to do. Cars still looked rubbish though but the fact now our heroes and villains needed to actually do something else than drive a quarter mile made me pleased.

Still - it went too far. There is no way when racing for a best place drifting would get you faster to the destination than regular driving. And the film frequently tried to convince us the other way. Drifting competitions are judged by the beauty, smoke and driving on the edge like being really close to other competitor but not by speed.

But as I said at least there was something to watch not like in the first film for example where were only few boring and stupid races and nothing to enjoy at all.

This one was slightly better in every way but it was far from perfect. Don't expect too much 6/10"
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;7;"Exactly what's expected to be a ""car drifter""";25.09.2023;True;"In order to appreciate this film, one must first like to see street racing films and alter his/her mind to not affiliate it with other ""Fast & The Furious"" films because none of the main stars are from anyone from the previous films but can be made entertaining as a film as it's own film! Story centers on rowdy American teenager whose known to drag race and always gets himself in trouble with the law but is the final straw, and he gets sent to Tokyo to live with his father to finish his schooling. Soon after he gets mixed up with another Japanese teenager whose associated with the Yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the mafia, with at the same time build rapport with another Asian person called Nam who also is attached to racing as well! The racing is not like the other races he's done on America but is introduced to 'race drifting' where the driver is driving around narrow roads and passageways like a tall building parking garage! Director Justin Lin must've seen a lot of Asian racing films such as ""Full Thottle"", ""The Legend of Speed"" and Jackie Chan's ""Thunderbolt"" to name a few where the acting is not so great but the racing scenes are the main focus and not so much on acting or story! Also interesting is that the film allows the actors to use their natural accents for there's an actress who has an Australian accent, natural Southern American accent and of course Japanese and Korean! There's some good one-liners and beautiful scenic buildings of downtown Tokyo, where the lights look great upon the reflections on the cars, and the techno pop soundtrack all works well with this film except that in terms of car crashes done on this film- it consists of stuff we had already seen before or done on previous films made before it, with the only difference that they're done on Tokyo and done on those specific models which there is nothing wrong with that too."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;5;Slick but largely empty action movie;11.05.2025;True;The film has a bit of promise when it opens, or at least some potential and a certain attitude and style. You have to kind of just accept it's a film about a pretty low iq character by any measure who's just obsessed with racing. It kind of has a certain attitude to it though which kind of works. After some mishaps our hero is packed off to Japan where he must race, of course there a good looking girl who's going out with the lock bad boy he needs to take on. The supporting cast are all okay. Everyone just looks way too old for school though, the film has many glaring logical problems too like how are these 17 year old boys meant to afford all these super cars?
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;8;Girls, fast cars, and MC Hammer;14.06.2006;True;Loved the film. Finally a summer movie that lives up to its worth. The first 15 minutes of the movie is the tightest i've ever seen. It just bowled over all the boring parts and keeps moving. The first race is the best I've ever seen. And just when I think that's it the second one tops it. The setting of Tokyo was a great choice and fresh. I didn't know MC Hammer owns that city. Sonny Chiba was cool but this Sung Kang guy is a stud. Can't wait to see him in other films. Oh yeah, the third chase gets even better and unlike other films, the last one actually lives up to its worth. Now I have a film to watch for the rest of the summer after I get disappointed by all the poser summer films out there.
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;6;Roppongi Vice.;10.06.2023;True;"Honestly, I think this is the only film in the F&F series that I hadn't seen prior to this little burst of rewatches I've been doing around ""Fast X"". I wasn't looking forward to it, as it's the lowest rated film in the series, but I found it to be pretty watchable stuff.

Having been involved in an accident whilst racing, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is sent to live with his father (Brian Goodman) in Tokyo. He struggles to fit in but makes a friend in fellow American Twinkie (Bow Wow) who introduces him to the local street racing scene. The enigmatic Han (Sung Kang) offers Sean the chance to drive his car but, unfamiliar with the drifting technique, he crashes it. Indebted to Han, Sean starts to work off his obligation, but Han's friends, particularly Takashi (Brian Tee) who has Yakuza connections, take a strong dislike to him.

So, whilst 'good' is still probably a step or two beyond it, I did, as I say, find the film the be pretty watchable stuff. It's again even more low key than the original film, let alone the way the many sequels have gone. Though there's a tangential link to the Yakuza there isn't even really that much crime in this film, (ignoring the one murder for a moment) it is literally just about street racing and for not much more than pride and status. Black is alright in the lead role, but there's definitely a reason that Han would be the character to recur more often in the series going forward, even though it would require not one, but two retcon's of his death for it to really make sense (such as it does). The film also has the legendary Sonny Chiba appear as Takashi's Yakuza uncle.

Even though it's missing the sorts of stunts that the series is now famous for I didn't mind my time with Tokyo Drift and whilst I can't imagine rushing back to it again anytime soon, It was a reasonable time."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;4;Awesome Right?;04.07.2011;True;"I found this movie no more or no less entertaining than the other ""Fast and Furious"" films; sexy women, tough guys, fast cars, and not much else. I mean I'm sure Bow Wow with all his talent from ""All That"" and ""Like Mike"" was the best choice, but considering the role it doesn't really matter. And of course a main stream pop culture soundtrack to keep the pace of the movie. It couldn't possibly have added more creativity to the project right? Most people enjoy these films for the aforementioned things, oh and did I mention the enjoyably simplistic plot to boot? What's not to like? With that said, in all seriousness, I can't rate crap higher than I already have, otherwise I'd be insulting film makers who actually strive to make a movie instead of an ninety minute music video."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;10;Superb flick;31.10.2014;True;"Greetings from Lithuania.

The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) is must see to fans of the franchise. Filled with good performances (really, did i just said that?) and good story, this chapter truly delivers. Being first directing effort in the series by Justin Lin - Tokyo Drift captured what fans (and not only them) have truly wanted from the movie, an involving story, fast cars, different approach to races, interesting characters. I truly believe that Tokyo Drift is the second best chapter in the franchise after superior ""Fast Five"". It delivers on every aspect. I saw it 3 time (more than any picture in the franchise), just because this movie it first off all about something, it has true real plot, with main character we start to care.

Overall, Tokyo Drift is truly great entertainment all around. It has everything that can expect from the series and more - a really involving story. Barvo, great film."
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.;1;Somebody please, take my wife.;23.06.2006;True;"What a disappointment. Lin gets noticed by making one of the best films on teenage disillusionment I've seen in recent times and then he has to go and make two complete stinkers. I didn't think that he could possibly stoop any lower than Annapolis, but I was proved wrong. Tokyo Drift could possibly be the worst idea for a film that I've ever seen. Believe me, I'm not so naive as to think every film that gets made needs to be an award winner. There's a place for Blockbuster, tent-pole fare. But who in God's name wants to see another freaking F&F? Honestly? If you go and see this film and enjoy it. Please do us all a favor and pour nitric acid on your eyeballs. You might then be forgiven for actually giving this film props, because hey, who's gonna tell a blind guy off for liking a bad movie? Not I.

Rodger Ebert, I'm so disappointed in you. Three stars?"
